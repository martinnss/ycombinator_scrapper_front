How it started In 2015, I joined my local fire department as a volunteer (young, but not as young as I was in this picture). In the years that followed, I completed 1500+ hours of training, got certified as an EMT, and started working as a paid firefighter at neighboring departments.  When my department bought new equipment or a new truck, we would turn to Facebook groups and word of mouth to sell our used equipment to other departments in need. For perspective, a new fire truck costs $1.5 to $2.5 million, with used trucks ranging in cost from $50,000 to $1 million. It was a super frustrating process for us:  Countless hours spent trying to find buyers in-need Navigating and losing money to scammers Coordinating independent logistics and financing providers   Garage\u2019s Solution Garage helps fire departments buy and sell used equipment in seconds rather than days. Our marketplace handles payments, freight, and financing \u2013 making buying and selling equipment easy. We're starting with fire departments because of my personal background, but the same problem of selling used equipment exists in many other verticals including construction, agriculture, and government surplus equipment. Meet the team We met while both studying at Columbia and have been friends for 6+ years. Before starting Garage, Alaz worked at Twitter and MemAI as a software engineer, and I worked as a private equity investor at Goldman Sachs. Email us at founders@withgarage.com. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "The Garage marketplace for used firefighting equipment presents a viable opportunity within the Latin American market, though with nuances.  Market size varies considerably across countries; larger, more developed nations will have a larger potential customer base.  However, budget constraints and procurement processes within Latin American fire departments might be a significant challenge.  Cultural factors such as trust and established relationships within the industry could influence adoption.  Economic considerations include the purchasing power of fire departments and the prevalence of financing options. A strong focus on building trust, offering multilingual support (Spanish and Portuguese), and potentially partnering with local distributors will be crucial for success.",

        "mvp": "Focus initially on a single, large Latin American country (e.g., Brazil or Mexico) with a robust online presence and a high concentration of fire departments. The MVP should feature a simplified platform with basic listing functionalities, secure payment integration (consider local payment gateways like Mercado Pago or PagSeguro), and partnerships with local logistics providers for freight.  A phased rollout, starting with a limited number of fire departments, will allow for feedback and iterative improvements.  Highlighting security features and addressing language barriers will be critical.  The MVP's success will be measured by the number of successful transactions and user feedback.  Consider creating a pilot program in collaboration with a major city's fire department to showcase the system's value and gain early traction."

        "feasibility_analysis": "Encore's conversational search for secondhand goods presents a compelling opportunity in Latin America.  The secondhand market is robust in many Hispanic countries due to economic factors and a growing awareness of sustainability. However, the success hinges on adapting to cultural nuances and technological infrastructure.  Market size varies significantly across the region; densely populated urban areas offer larger potential than rural regions.  Key considerations include language localization (Spanish variations), payment gateway integration for local methods (e.g., OXXO, Mercado Pago), and addressing potential connectivity issues in certain areas.  Understanding local shopping habits and preferences is crucial for effective marketing and product positioning.  Competition from existing e-commerce platforms and local secondhand marketplaces will need to be analyzed.",

At Palmier, we\u2019re building a new kind of code repository designed for AIs. Every line of code has a history behind it, and we\u2019re making that history accessible for AIs to create more efficient and reliable code, aligned with human intention.  Our first product is a platform that helps developers work seamlessly with AI, improving efficiency. We aim to provide an API for any AI to interact with code, giving it the information needed to produce better quality code.

The market size for developer tools is growing, particularly in larger tech hubs like Mexico City, Bogot\u00e1, and S\u00e3o Paulo. However, penetration is limited compared to mature markets.  Cultural nuances must be considered; technical documentation and support should be in Spanish and Portuguese.

At FurtherAI, we are building a workforce of AI Teammates to handle these repetitive manual tasks involving unstructured data processing and data entry across disjointed systems. Our first AI Teammate tirelessly handles quote and renewal workflows, allowing the human teams to focus on strategic work. \ud83d\udc47 Here is a heartfelt video from a customer highlighting their problems & opportunity   \u274c PROBLEM It\u2019s widely reported that the insurance industry will lose over 400K people by 2026. On the other hand, over 3M insurance professionals spend most of their time manually generating proposals, checking policies, processing claims, or entering data into underwriting systems. Most of these tasks have remained manual for two reasons:  The insurance industry operates on a lot of unstructured data like policies, quotes & more The software systems in the insurance industry are not connected, requiring humans to manually fill in data and forms across these systems.  Previously, it was not possible to process the unstructured data with high accuracy, and it was difficult to configure all the validation rules. To make things worse, Robotic Process Automation was too brittle to maintain. These manual workflows take the time of the skilled workforce away from the important tasks, reducing productivity and job satisfaction. One such manual workflow is quote generation: a mid-sized (50-200 EEs) broker/MGA generates 1000s of quotes per month by extracting data from policy documents and then entering into portals. It takes about 30-45 mins per quote. \ud83d\udca1 SOLUTION At FurtherAI, we are building a workforce of AI Teammates to automate insurance workflows. These AI Teammates can practically automate any insurance workflow involving processing unstructured documents, data entry into internal systems or web portals, or even making phone calls. Here is a quick demo of the AI Teammate performing Quote Generation. It is a simple workflow:   1. Trigger - Send an email along with the client application attached 2. Clarification - Respond to the missing information asked by AI 3. Result - Get the generated quote along with the execution video We are building these AI Teammates to mimic human-to-human interaction.  Everything happens within the email client (Outlook/Gmail) We run fine-tuned GPT models for the insurance industry We are building agentic loops to make the automation reliable  Our initial customers are saving over $400K in annual costs across these workflows while making them 10X faster and less prone to human errors. We are starting with the workflows of quote generation and renewals as they directly impact the top line of our customers. \ud83e\udd1d WHO ARE WE? We\u2019re Aman and Sashank. Aman is a second-time founder with around 10 years of experience in workflow automation. Previously he built and scaled his company to over $1 million ARR and worked as a Product Manager at Microsoft. Sashank is a former language modeling scientist at Apple, where he built and scaled language models for Siri. Previously he completed his Masters in AI from Georgia Tech and worked at Oracle. We believe that, like energy, the cost of insurance affects the entire economy, and improving efficiencies here benefits everyone. Together, we\u2019re excited to help insurance companies unlock unprecedented efficiencies with AI.

The market size for sports betting varies greatly across Latin American countries; some have robust regulated markets, while others are still developing or have limited legal frameworks.  Cultural nuances are crucial: the popularity of specific sports differs regionally, influencing app design and marketing. Economic factors also play a large role; user affordability and access to reliable internet are key limitations, particularly in less developed regions.  The high level of technical complexity and the regulatory hurdles in each individual country presents significant obstacles to a simple market launch.  A phased rollout, starting with countries with more developed digital infrastructure and legalized sports betting, would be essential.  Tailoring the app to include popular local sports and integrating with local payment systems are critical for success.

We're on a mission to make testing easy and fast for developers. TL;DR Developers author E2E tests 10X faster with Momentic\u2019s low-code editor. We make AI do the heavy lifting for you: finding elements, reasoning about assertions, visual comparisons, and even generating whole test cases! Testing still sucks! The average developer today still spends hundreds of hours every year writing and maintaining test suites in Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright. Existing no-code solutions like Browserstack and Tricentis are often unreliable and difficult to use, forcing teams to fallback on manual QA. The bottom line is: testing slows you down, and all companies eventually encounter a tradeoff between velocity and quality. What if testing could help developers ship faster? Our low-code test editor replaces traditional test scripts with AI-powered, self-healing steps. It seamlessly integrates into your existing workflows: from local development to CI/CD environments and production. Here\u2019s how it works: Interact with your app in plain English.  Craft assertions from any logical statement or visual condition.  Record and replay actions on any site, even those on localhost.  Meet the team We\u2019re Wei-Wei and Jeff - two software engineers who dreaded testing so much we founded a company to do it for us \ud83d\ude02. We-Wei was a founding engineer at Nashi and then a staff engineer at Density, leading product engineering and product reliability.

We\u2019re Anthony and Connor, aka the Ontra Mobility team, and we\u2019re revolutionizing how people move. \u2757 The Problem Transit agencies in the U.S. are facing massive budget shortfalls (up to $3B). Agencies need to adapt their transit systems more quickly to meet the demands of our evolving cities. Work from home led to a large drop in ridership, which is problematic for train and bus routes, which have high fixed costs. Cutting lines or reducing frequency further impacts ridership - transit agencies need a different solution. \ud83d\udca1 The Solution  Ontra helps cities and other transit agencies increase ridership through data-driven planning and real-time optimization. Our platform optimizes cost and rider experience by designing high-frequency bus routes and ridesharing zones, where our algorithms adapt routes to demand in real time. \u2699\ufe0f How It Works Ontra analyzes information about where people live, how they've traveled in the past, and the existing transit system to figure out the best way to redesign the transit network. Once the improvements are made, Ontra Mobility plans rider journeys in real-time with the best combination of transit options available, whether it\u2019s a train, bus, bike, or agency-operated on-demand. Our system can handle thousands of ridesharing requests per minute \u2013 efficiently assigning riders to optimal routes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-RyHtEurVk   \ud83d\ude8c What\u2019s New  Our transit network design application generates bus routes and micro-transit zones Seamless multimodal journeys \u2013 our algorithm synchronizes transfers between on-demand and fixed-route  \ud83c\udf93 The Team  Anthony and Connor are both former Google engineers with PhDs in operations research.

While reading images, we allow radiologists to dictate what they see, and RadMate AI will generate and proofread reports for them. The problem Radiologists spend most of their day reading patient images and dictating reports based on the images. As patient access to imaging continues to rise, radiologists face escalating pressure to produce detailed reports quickly. However, the software they use hasn\u2019t changed in over a decade, so radiologists are no longer well-equipped to meet rising demand.  Radiologists dictate over 30% more words than they need to, which can lead to fewer reports, burnout, and lower quality reporting. Over 20% of radiology reports have errors in them. Which can lead to treatment delays, poor outcomes, higher healthcare costs, lost revenue, and operational inefficiencies.  Our solution LLMs provide an opportunity to revamp the way radiologists report. We\u2019ve created a platform with an AI copilot that decreases stress on radiologists and increases accuracy by:  Minimizing the words radiologists have to say. Reducing the number of clicks required for report generation. Proofreading reports to reduce errors.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Greptile faces a challenging but potentially rewarding path in the Latin American market.  The market size for software development is growing, particularly in countries with burgeoning tech hubs like Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina. However, the target audience (software developers and engineering teams) is comparatively smaller than consumer markets.  Cultural nuances are less of a direct concern, as technical proficiency transcends language barriers. Economic factors pose a challenge; many Latin American companies may prioritize cost-effective solutions over premium AI-powered tools.  A tiered pricing model catering to different company sizes and budgets will be essential.  Focusing initial efforts on larger companies in key tech hubs with established development practices would likely yield faster results.",

Prior to this, he studied computer engineering, astrophysics and robotics at the University of Pennsylvania, and researched robot motion planners at MIT.Lakshay SharmaCerulion\u00a0\u00a0Se Hwan Jeon, FounderI'm the cofounder of Cerulion along with Lakshay Sharma. Cerulion is a software interface and abstraction layer to make controlling, debugging, and visualizing commercial robots accessible to everyone.  Prior to YC, I studied mechanical engineering at the University of Notre Dame and MIT, specializing in robotics, optimal control, and reinforcement learning for legged platforms.Se Hwan JeonCerulion\u00a0Company LaunchesCerulion \ud83e\udd16 Fast, reliable, cross-platform robot middlewareRobots are expensive and hard to develop/debug. Cerulion solves the robot tooling problem to cut down development times by up to 10x. The Problem The incredibly high capital costs required for robotics, combined with the inherently non-deterministic nature of embodied intelligence, result in an unpredictable system where even attempts, let alone failures, are cost-prohibitive. Robots are expensive and hard. And yet, despite time on hardware being such a precious resource, roboticists today are absolutely wasting 90% of it fighting against unoptimized tooling. Some common complaints are:  Needlessly complex to install, maintain, and document Incredibly steep learning curve for non-transferable skills Poor observability into a robot's belief Artificial non-determinism induced by slow or unreliable message-passing Unreliable network protocols and IPCs System breakdown due to poor inter-robot communication Unreliable logging and cumbersome/nondeterministic log replay Wasting precious field time parsing 1000s of lines of runtime errors whooshing past the screen  And the list goes on and on. Robot tooling today is broken. Unacceptably so. Our Solution: Performance never looked this good!   Packaged as an app, rather than a CLI tool: Instead of shipping as a bunch of CLI tools to be installed, patched, and reinstalled, Cerulion is an app you can download on Windows, Mac, or Linux. It will smartly detect and handle any dependencies as needed. Intuitive, cross-platform visualizer: The sleek, easy-to-use GUI is the main way of communicating with your robot in the field, which means you can run it with minimal resources on your favorite long-lasting laptop with any OS, instead of that RGB laptop with a gaming GPU running Linux. Minimal boilerplate and setup: The way you program robots in Cerulion is designed to get out of your way, so you can focus on the planner and perception algorithms instead of worrying about the inter-process comms, IP addresses, or network routes. Fast and reliable communication: We leverage cutting-edge Rust-based networking and IPC stacks like Zenoh and IceOryx2, along with tried and tested C++ alternatives like LCM and IceOryx. By ensuring communications don't fail silently and messages are delivered when expected, Cerulion eliminates nasty surprises in safety-critical scenarios.  Meet The Team  As robotics PhD students at MIT, Lakshay and Se Hwan have gathered years of experience (and frustration) working on robots, and want to see a world where you can take robot reliability for granted.

We\u2019re Davide and Lenny from Diode Computers, Inc. TL;DR: Diode is an end-to-end platform for circuit board design. With the help of AI, we can finish a months-long design project in days, and then ship working boards straight to your door. Try out our designer at https://pcb.new/, or shop generated boards at https://pcb.store/. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOoG2gl8wdY   Problem Designing printed circuit boards (PCBs) is really hard. Existing tools provide little opportunity for design reuse, so most projects are started from scratch. Since there\u2019s no good way to test your design, your best bet is to just order them and hope for the best. Thought you were done? Nope \u2014 ordering PCBs is a pain too. Now you need to source the components, ship them across the globe to your manufacturer, and constantly be on the lookout for part shortages and replacements. It\u2019s a full-time job. Solution Diode solves this by owning the entire PCB design process end-to-end. It starts with a core of composable, reusable modules that users can stitch together to build their boards. When new use cases come up, our AI generator creates new modules in seconds instead of days. And with rigorously-tested modules instead of de novo designs, we can be confident that each board works first try.  We then take the user\u2019s design and automatically translate it into manufacturing requirements to send to the factory. We stockpile all of the necessary components to remove the burden of supply chain management from users and amortize the cost of parts across all designs. The result is an all-in-one platform for hardware design: describe what you need and get working boards delivered to your door. Why In a past life, we designed hardware at companies like Apple, and we encountered a problem: PCBs never worked on the first try. At best, they required micro-soldering surgery under a microscope and, at worst, a whole new board. These issues were driving us mad, so we started a company to fix it. We want to make hardware design work more like software. Fast iteration cycles, reusable components with clean composition, and one-click ordering to build your products fast and cheap. Our vision is to turn PCB design into a software problem. P.S. Want a customized NFC business card with your logo?

Previously he worked as a software engineer in Microsoft Azure building low-latency compute infrastructure. His first startup, UniFlow, provided remote campus engagement software for tens of thousands of college students during Covid.Andrew DixonGander\u00a0Company LaunchesGander: AI Customer Service for AirlinesTL;DR: Gander is using AI to automate customer service for airlines. We are working with our first airline to automate the back-office tasks involved with processing reimbursement claims, while building a voice agent that\u00a0calls customers to get them on a new flight if they miss their original one. Gander Demo   Problem Airline\u2019s are sitting on the biggest customer service problem in the world taking into account complexity, volume, and regulation. In fact, global airlines spend nearly $80 Billion Dollars on customer service every year. When it comes to disruptions (when things go wrong), supporting customers is hard for three reasons:   Volume Spikes: Anyone flying during the Crowd-Strike Outage, Southwest\u2019s Christmas Meltdown, or during March 2020 knows this problem deeply. Airline\u2019s can have their claims and support volume increase 100X overnight.    Regulation: Every country has their own passenger rights laws for what passenger\u2019s are entitled to. Complying with them introduces mistakes, back office over head, and introduces airlines to litigation and liability    Messy Data: To process a reimbursement claim on behalf of a passenger, the airline has to manually review receipts and flight logs while doing painful verifications in antiquated legacy systems    Solution Gander Forms: Helps Airlines Process Compensation & Reimbursement Claims  White-labeled AI forms experience or API on top of airline\u2019s existing process Gander reimburses passengers for food, transportation, hotel, baggage delay & damage expenses according to airline policy & regulations Uses AI to cut agent cost, fraud, in-accurate claims, and protects against lawsuits from EU-261, Brazil ANAC, Canada APPR & more  Gander Voice: Proactive Voice Agent to Change/Move Flights  GenAI voice agent pro-actively calls customers who have been disrupted to review flight options and answer questions Stops customers from calling live agents, creating long airport queues, or using chat resources Can be configured to be proactive to certain loyalty populations, disruption types, or switched to reactive  Our Vision We want to bring LLMs to the 1T airline industry. Industry incumbents take multiple-years to catch up to new technologies - we want to beat them to it. We see customer service as our wedge into becoming a trusted vendor to bring LLMs to the critical workflows it takes to transport people via air. Our founding team experience with this problem space first hand having spent time at United, American, and investing in aviation software at Insight Partners. Here are some examples of expansions for a flight for a delayed flight from New York to London:  Finding A New Crew: The delay will cause the existing crew to not have enough regulated rest time. Gander can automate the process of calling and texting reserve crew to see if they can report to the airport to service the new flight Finance/Accounting: The flight will spin off dozens of invoices from fuel, air navigation service providers, and airport vendors. Gander can ingest these invoices and true them up to the actual services consumed for the flight given its delay (rather than standard rule sets) Operations: The new flight time will invalidate the filed routing. Gander can process Route Availability Documents (RADs) to determine what airways and routes will be most efficient to take given the new departure time  Traction We are launching with our first airline customer in the next 6 weeks and have a robust pipeline of airlines that together fly 100M+ passengers to service afterwards Asks  If you know anyone who works in the airline industry in the US or abroad, we would love to chat with them (arjan@usegander.com)! If you have any stories (good or bad) interacting with customer support, we want to hear from you as well!  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Gander's LLM-powered airline customer service solution presents a compelling opportunity in the Latin American market, but requires careful consideration.  The market size is significant, given the growing air travel sector in the region. However, the implementation faces challenges.  While many Latin American airlines experience similar customer service issues (high volume, complex regulations, legacy systems), the level of technological adoption varies considerably across countries.  Cultural nuances regarding customer service expectations and communication preferences must also be addressed (e.g., language support beyond Spanish, preference for phone vs. digital communication).  Economic factors, including airline budgets and willingness to invest in new technologies, need careful evaluation.

We do this by providing a beautiful Google-like interface and a co-pilot that connects to all your company apps and tools.     \u274c Problem Having worked at Google and Microsoft, we experienced first-hand how difficult it is to access and find information and perform actions across multiple SaaS tools both in the workplace and in engineering. Through our experience and conversations with people at Appian, Boeing, General Electric, Uber, Pinecone, Brex, Coda, Unity, Microsoft, and Google, we learned that as companies grow it gets very challenging to:  Find what you need at work: Company knowledge lives in multiple, isolated SaaS applications, and employees spend over a quarter of their workday looking for information (think of documentation, past slack threads, etc), finding the people needed to complete tasks, and getting the required permissions. Manage complex engineering tools: As engineering teams scale and adopt microservices, they onboard multiple tools for documentation, development, release, monitoring, and alerting. Critical data, metrics, logs, and dashboards are all in isolated platforms such as CircleCI, DataDog, and New Relic and this makes it very difficult to have a unified view of company data, correlation data across these tools, and complete multitool workflow coordination - especially during incidents.   Siloed tooling and data introduce an operational tax to the lives of employees like engineers, slowing down productivity, development cycles, and incident management. Workers spend an average of a quarter of their day searching for information. All of this time can be used to write more code, do more deals, and talk to customers. With the rise of AI and Copilots, the value of the time spent on doing actual work has never been so high. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Our Solution \ud83d\udd0e Enterprise Search for everyone in your company: Integrate all of your company\u2019s applications, tooling, and data sources to power organizational and team-level search.

Context: customers want SAML There are lots of different ways to authenticate (i.e. log in) users in software. Companies often require their employees to use single sign-on (SSO) to access business software, both for convenience and security. For the most part, especially in large companies, SSO relies on an old, complicated protocol called SAML. (If you\u2019ve used a service like Okta before, you\u2019ve likely used SAML without realizing it!) If you make business software, you probably will need to support SAML at some point. Problem: SAML is hard But SAML is really hard, even for experienced developers. It just doesn\u2019t work like most modern software, making implementations slow and risky. Companies as sophisticated as GitLab can make very costly mistakes. What we do: we make SAML easy SSOReady makes SAML safe and easy enough that developers can often finish an implementation in less than a day. SSOReady is an open-source (MIT) service that helps developers implement SAML single sign-on without ever touching SAML directly. Devs just need to implement two API endpoints: one to initiate SAML logins and another to receive incoming SAML messages. And then they\u2019re pretty much done. SSOReady also offers a similar tool for SCIM, a protocol often used alongside SAML to provision and de-provision users. Developers can use SCIM to establish a live sync between their database of users and their customers\u2019 central IT systems.

Know a private practice doctor? We\u2019d love to talk to them: founders@syntra.com. Hi everyone, we are Ayush and Aniketh, the team behind Syntra.  The Problem: Healthcare admin costs are skyrocketing. Doctors currently spend an average of 5% to 10% of their total revenue on manual administrative tasks, amounting to over $100 billion dollars spent each year. The burden is even higher on private practice doctors who can\u2019t afford to hire a full administrative team. Our Solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Mkt0IRtNM   Syntra is an intelligent EHR that automates administrative tasks for doctors, such as patient intake, scribing, inventory management, and medical billing. Our goal is for doctors to not think about anything except providing the best patient care possible. We earn our first customer over $100k a month while reducing time spent on these tasks by 25-30%. How It Works: Syntra records the doctor-patient interaction and converts it into an accurate clinical note. This note is then automatically converted into a correct claim and sent to insurance through our clearinghouse. Syntra also keeps track of inventory levels and at-risk patients to intelligently order supplies and remind patients to book an appointment. Our Ask: If you know any private practice doctors, we would love to demo our system to them! Reach out to founders@syntra.com or book a demo here. Company PhotoHear from the foundersHow did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)We met through mutual friends at Duke University and became close when we realized we had the same randomly assigned freshman year dorm room a year apart. After hearing from doctors in our network that their software solutions always felt short of what they needed, we knew we had an idea to work on. We built our first product, an AI Biller, in 1 day and realized we were onto something when it earned an additional $100k a month for our first customer. Since then, we have expanded our product to an all encompassing EHR that is personalized to the doctor\u2019s workflow and automates all administrative tasks seamlessly. How did you decide to apply to Y Combinator? What was your experience applying, going through the batch, and fundraising at demo day?We decided to apply to Y Combinator after the success of our AI biller pilot. We applied late to the batch and were accepted only 1.5 weeks before the retreat! We immediately found last-minute housing and bought one-way tickets to San Francisco. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?Syntra will reduce administrative spend in healthcare and make it easier for doctors to run their own practices. Doctors will begin leveraging EHRs as tools that enhance their work, rather than simply adapting to use them. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Syntra's AI-powered EHR solution presents a significant opportunity in the Latin American market, where many private practices still rely on outdated systems.  The large number of private practices, coupled with a growing demand for efficient healthcare solutions, creates a sizable market. However, several key considerations exist.  Firstly, digital literacy and internet access vary widely across the region, requiring a multi-tiered approach to implementation and potentially limiting initial market penetration. Secondly, cultural nuances in medical practices and billing systems need to be addressed through localized adaptations. Finally, economic factors, particularly pricing strategies and payment options, must be tailored to the specific demographics of target countries.  A phased rollout focusing on specific high-income, tech-savvy areas might be a more effective approach than a wide, simultaneous launch.",

JARVIS and Samantha are assistant archetypes created within the scarcity mindset of an obsolete age. Instead of waiting for you to ask, jo helps you proactively at the edge. Always a \u2018hey jo\u2019 or \u2018\u2318-j\u2019 away, jo works alongside you, helping with the low stakes but high frequency actions that make up the high stakes ones - keystrokes, taps, speech and screen. A new type of assistance for a new age. jo\u2019s built on top of a set of local and remote LLMs, vector storage and tight audio/network macOS native desktop code that unlock a new set of composable primitives for how humans interact with AI efficiently. In practice, jo gets you halfway to most of the way there for common workflows, building user trust for its next phase of development where we push towards autonomous completion of high stakes / low frequency projects.  Speak or type to jo, it will speak and type back \u2013 latencies are low enough that you can lean on jo all day as AI on your side that works hard for you.

As local and remote models improve in capability, jo will inherit new abilities rapidly as we build trust & tech towards truly agentic behavior  Sign up for the waitlist here >. We are sending invites out every day.  Why jo Feels Different  Natural and intuitive. You actually talk to jo like you would a friend. No weird commands to memorize or crazy prompt engineering. No switching models. Ridiculously fast. jo works as fast as you can speak. Summaries, browser tasks, calendar checks\u2014it\u2019s all instant since we built the app using native Swift for Apple Silicon and have spent weeks cutting latency across multiple integrated systems. No distractions. jo\u2019s got a clean, focused interface that keeps you in flow state.  Designed For Composability jo\u2019s new usability primitives are concise distillations of learnings over the course of a year from preview versions of jo on telegram mobile, group chat experiences, single-player experiences and now macOS desktop.  **\"Fast comms\"** We speak faster than we type. We can read faster than we can listen. jo uses text and audio in/out, in parallel. Get the gist by listening, get the rest by reading. **\"Async execution\"** jo works alongside you, not blocking your work loop. Handoff stuff for jo to do. If you're an engineer, it\u2019s like spinning up many new Actors for your life. **\"Work before I get to it\"** jo kicks things off for you before you expend more cognitive effort. Start with the gist, then review the main points, then read the details. **\"Save the important\"** jo captures choice information privately in many facets, uses that on every interaction to build a better picture of you, and actually attempts to be better with your feedback. **\"Be my agent\"** jo pushes new info you care about to you, and reaches out on your behalf.  Chainable primitives like these wind up being compelling when they're composed into your ad hoc demands. Using these primitives is the first step to building daily trust for true \u201cagency\u201d, where jo can execute high stakes goals (ex: organize and pay for expensive things, or draft and send critical emails). While it\u2019s possible even now to \u201cclose the loop\u201d with high stakes projects (for example jo sending an email or paying for a flight), we realized the trust building required needs a path, which is the true blocker. New Things You Can Do With jo Improve a low-stakes/high-frequency pattern you may do every day \u201cread hacker news\u201d \u2014 With jo, you can now command-hover using jo over every interesting link in the list, getting an exec summary inline. Since this type of reading is usually ritualized behavior, jo will prioritize helping you process more info vs saving time. Soon, you can \"clip\" a live summary to save for later. Start off a high-stakes, low-frequency request:  \"find me a free weekend in the next month and show me new york flights\" \u2014 jo's connected to both your work & personal calendars and will run this search using google APIs, find the open weekends, and then pull up google flights in your browser with all the relevant info pre-filled. It's faster than you at this and you can chain more steps. Complicated ad hoc requests:  \"will i see a good sunset tonight in pacifica, and where can i eat after?\"\u00a0 \u2014 jo will use a pre-connected weather API, find temp and visibility, construct the answer, and will likely present the awesome Taco Bell on the beach as one of the places to eat without opening any browsers. We are working towards jo being able to ambiently push you showtimes for this weekend for the new Ghibli movie because it knows (with your permission) that you and your 7yo like watching them together. Engineering at jo Building jo is an ongoing systems engineering and LLM application/design challenge. We believe latency and quality trumps all for daily-use products like jo and are obsessed with improving both every single day. We\u2019re just now scratching the surface and are sanding down the rough edges with this preview release. We\u2019d love your help with unraveling any unexpected behavior you see. We ship very fast with very small, very tight teams. Reach out if you:  Are a very senior macOS / iOS engineer AND/OR Understand the nuances of fine-tuning local models  FAQ  How do I try jo?  Waitlist is here > We are sending invites every day. First come, first served.   Why a waitlist?  To ensure our systems keep up with the scale and usage. To find and fix any bugs. To listen to our early adopters and build.   How does jo use LLMs?  We run remote large models on Azure with contracts requiring no data sharing. We run local small models on your machine for just the \u201clive summary\u201d feature (as of now).   How do you save & share my data?  We use hosted Postgres and a local vector data store running on our servers. We send text to remote LLMs that are run on Azure, with \u201cno data sharing\u201d protections in place. In our preview period, we\u2019re using 3P audio transcribers and synthesizers, and you are also subject to their (sometimes changing) policies. More details upon request, and we are working to stabilize this.   Hardware specs needed?  Any Mac with a \u201cM\u201d chip  M2+ works best M1 works fine but live summaries are a touch slower   At least 8GB shared RAM, more the better.   Will there be mobile apps?  Yes, shortly. They will have similar functionality but will most likely start with just remote LLMs.   Is my mic on all the time?  No, only when you turn it on manually. If you opt-in to the \u201chey jo\u201d feature \u2013 if and only if jo\u2019s mic is enabled, the system mic will remain on listening for the \u201chey jo\u201d voice trigger   Can I turn off \u2018hey jo\u2019?  Yes. jo will still activate when you press \u2018\u2318-j\u2019   Can I use jo with just a chat window and turn off all audio?  Yup, if you prefer. You can turn the audio input and audio output together and individually, on/off   Is jo always watching my screen?  No. Once you enable live summaries and active screen sharing, jo will only have access to the frontmost window on your desktop. When this feature is turned off, no screen content is transmitted or processed. Any screen that\u2019s being cached remotely expires after 10 minutes.   Why pre-filled searches and not running the searches yourself?  Faster, chainable, more relevant, more control on the user\u2019s side   Can I get more detailed summaries than the short \u201clive summary\u201d?  Yes, you can ask further questions of jo about any browser window/tab or (for now) select apps we support.   Can I get my favorite local model to be the jo LLM?  Not yet, but soon.   Are you working on a local-only jo?  That\u2019s privileged info.   How much does jo cost?  jo is free to use during the preview period for the next 3 months. More pricing details in early 2025.

        "mvp": "Focus on a specific niche within the Latin American market, perhaps starting with a single country with robust digital infrastructure and a high concentration of fintechs.  The MVP should demonstrate the core value proposition: reduced investigation time for a specific type of fraud (e.g., account takeovers).  This could involve partnering with a smaller, forward-thinking fintech to integrate and test the AI agent on a limited scale.  Data collection and analysis for this MVP should prioritize ease of integration with existing systems, acknowledging potential differences in data formats across institutions. Success will be measured by the reduction in investigation time and demonstrable cost savings for the partner.  Gathering testimonials and case studies will be crucial for subsequent marketing and expansion into other markets.  Focus on Spanish-language marketing materials and local partnerships will significantly boost market adaptability."

Simple AI can make AI powered phone calls on your behalf. Simple can wait on hold and navigate phone trees. Simple can make phone calls in 33 countries using 15 different languages, or even call 10 different stores at the same time.  We tested a beta version of the app extensively with our initial set of 1000 users. We wanted to make sure Simple could successfully perform a variety of tasks, including: making restaurant reservations; finding and booking doctors, dentist, and vision appointments; asking grocery stores, hardware stores, and other retail stores for availability or stock; calling customer support to ask for help with accounts, billing, and more.  We started Simple AI with the simple vision to bring the power of AI to regular people. We went through YC\u2019s Summer 24 batch. During YC, we saw many startups working on ideas that leverage the new AI and LLM technology to upend various industries. But no one was working on AI for consumers. It turns out people really hate making phone calls, and our AI is pretty good at it. In fact, it\u2019s better than a human at certain tasks. Zach and Cat both needed a new eye doctor and independently set out to find one that would 1) take our new insurance, and 2) had availability soon. Zach did some research on the internet and got an appointment 3 weeks out. Cat had Simple call 15 optometrists near Potrero Hill and got hers in 6 days.

The first time you may have seen us, you saw our MVP. Today, here\u2019s our V1, and how we\u2019re building the future of coding with AI. TL;DR: AI is transforming how coding is done. Developers want to leverage AI as much as possible, but can\u2019t keep up with the evolving landscape of available tools. PearAI offers an open-source solution with up-to-date, curated inventory of the best AI tools, natively integrated for effortless AI-powered coding. Demo https://youtu.be/UpxhRnKj5Ck?si=P0xsVY8COvKF7Tqe   The Problem: For developers: \u201cAI is transforming how development is done and I want to increase my productivity to the max using AI\u201d  I don\u2019t know which are the best AI tools to use I don\u2019t want 5+ different subscriptions and having to keep up with all of them and new ones User experience with different tools is clunky and fragmented I don\u2019t know how to integrate them into my workflow and fully utilize them  For AI coding tools: \u201cI built the best AI tool for a use case. I want it to be integrated into a user\u2019s workflow and to distribute to more users.\u201d  Difficult to have tools communicate with other tools in the AI tech stack. Churn is high because users don\u2019t know how to integrate the tool into workflow Distribution is hard and cost per acquisition is high  Current AI code editors:  Not open source, this leads to  Lack of trust and transparency from big companies.On developer tooling teams that Pan and Nang have worked at, onboarding Cursor was not possible due to this. An open source developer tool would be much more favorable. Lack of community and flexibility; a code editor is the best product to be open source because developers actually use the product and know best how to improve it.   Try to solve coding with AI as a one-size-fits-all solution. For each specific part of coding with AI (ie. autocomplete, RAG, search, deploy, personalization, etc.), there exists another product that specializes in solving this single part - and does it better. This trend will only continue in the future. Check out the YC batch every season.  The Solution An extendable, open source AI code editor. Imagine if VSCode was made knowing that AI was going to transform how development is done. For developers:  Native integrations for the best user experience. A single unified UX for all AI tools. Single subscription for access to all tools Active open source community, helping with new features and customer support, led by build-in-public founders PearAI curates an inventory of the best AI tools on the market.  For AI Tools:  PearAI integrates the tool into a unified, seamless user experience/workflow that users know and love. Here\u2019s exactly what we mean:  Functionality that users want from the tool is kept intact. The AI tool can communicate with other AI tools within PearAI if needed. Native integration into PearAI\u2019s UX is added for AI tools. We uphold bring-your-own-API-key on tools that support it. AI tools gain more visibility and users. We currently have Continue, aider, mem0, and Perplexity as integrations under a single UX. As always, it\u2019s made extremely clear that the user is using the underlying tool, and that they can (and should!) use the tool independently if they so choose. If an AI tool is paid, the company can charge using their API key or preferred plan. The AI tool will have the option to gain deeper insights and usage data from users within PearAI.    Our Vision: Currently, we have hit a checkpoint in our product, where layers of the tech stack (i.e. Search, Chat, Code Generation etc.) can communicate with each other under a single, beautiful user experience our users love. This is our V1, and we\u2019re just getting started. Building for the future, we envision PearAI as a flexible framework for AI tools to live and integrate. Not only will the number of layers of the AI tech stack grow, but the number of companies solving each layer of this AI tech stack will grow as well. As a result, the quality of each product for every part of coding with AI will improve. The best user experience can be achieved if these AI tools have a framework to communicate with each other, and users have access to them in a single, unified IDE.\u00a0 With PearAI, we\u2019re hoping to build a win-win ecosystem where users can make what they want, while AI companies gain expanded reach and deeper insights.

Most of these answers already exist and need to be manually kept up-to-date. Also, it requires manual chasing down of other teams (e.g. compliance) for recently certified answers. A lot of effort that could be otherwise spent on higher value fundraising tasks. Our Solution: We automate finding fresh answers, maintenance of the database, and intracompany communication. Existing solutions either don\u2019t get used or they need a team of 5 to manage it. GovernGPT, natively powered by gen-AI and purpose-built for asset managers, frees up the time for 4 out of those 5. In the end, GovernGPT exports these questionnaires in the very same format they came in with answers filled out. Product Video Demo   Who we are We're Mamal and Oliver, best friends who love mountains and craft beers :) We've collectively built GPTs from scratch, developed back-office products that elicit consumer-level joy, and published Machine Learning papers - all this at startups, scale-ups, large corporates, and consulting firms like McKinsey. This photo is us right after we got GovernGPT swag!  How you can help us We\u2019re currently piloting with a private credit, a hedge fund, and a private equity firm.

        "feasibility_analysis": "GovernGPT presents a compelling solution to a real problem faced by asset managers in Latin America, albeit within a niche market.  The market size for this solution is limited to large asset management firms, which are less prevalent in Latin America compared to North America or Europe.  However, the increasing sophistication of the financial sector in key markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia creates an opportunity. Cultural nuances are less of a concern as the core value proposition is efficiency and automation, universally desirable.  Economic factors are important; adoption will likely be higher among larger firms with more resources.  Success hinges on adapting the platform to local regulations and investor preferences, perhaps offering multilingual support and integrating with commonly used financial systems in the region.",

        "mvp": "Focus on a pilot program with 1-2 large asset management firms in a single Latin American market (e.g., Brazil or Mexico). The MVP should demonstrate the core functionality: automated questionnaire completion from existing data sources. This would involve integrating with commonly used data management systems within those firms, prioritizing seamless data transfer and accurate answer generation. Feedback from the pilot will inform further development and localization before broader market expansion."

Currently building Fresco, the scribe for construction superintendents.Akhil GuptaFresco\u00a0Company LaunchesFresco: The scribe for constructionWe\u2019re Arvind and Akhil, and we\u2019re building Fresco. TL;DR Fresco is a scribe for construction superintendents, helping them create 1000s of pages of documentation 10x faster. We free up time for supes to do what matters most: keep projects on time and under budget. The Problem: Documentation sucks Imagine spending half your work day doing your actual job\u2026and the other half just writing down what you did. That\u2019s the reality for 210k+ construction superintendents (or supervisors, foremen, PMs, etc.) across the USA. Project management tools like Procore and ACC have dramatically increased documentation requirements: supes are spending up to 3 hours a day creating documents for compliance, regulation, and to keep various stakeholders informed. This is on top of their actual job, which is to quarterback construction projects and manage safety, quality, timelines, and more. Fresco creates documents in minutes, not hours. By the time supes walk back to their trailers at the end of the day, all of their documents are already waiting for them. The Solution: AI scribe Today, most supes already walk around job sites with their phones, taking photos or brief videos to capture problems or observations on site. But, at the end of the day, they do the very manual work of matching photos with their paper notes to create detailed \u201cpunch lists\u201d or logs. In Fresco, supes simply narrate over videos they take on site. For example, they might point the camera at a corroded beam and say something like \u201cThe beam in the southwest corner of room 134 is corroded and needs replacement by Alex.\u201d Fresco pulls out this action item along with a picture of the beam so Alex can get the job done. Supes who use Fresco complete their notes, on average, 90% faster.  In this video, you can see how a supe and a project manager voice over a school refit we worked on. Normally, creating the final report takes 2+ hours. Fresco uses the info captured on the walkthrough and creates the report in less than a minute. https://youtu.be/LOu3g9A6P2w\u00a0   Fresco offers one-click integrations with Procore and ACC, so if supes need to enter their data there, they can easily do this without ever leaving Fresco. We\u2019ve worked on sites that are using both Procore and ACC, and Fresco saves supes hours they\u2019d otherwise spend double-entering notes.

Economic factors such as varying levels of technology adoption across countries need to be accounted for; some regions might have limited access to reliable internet or mobile data, affecting the app's usability.  The pricing model must be tailored to the economic realities of the target market, possibly exploring tiered pricing or subscription options.

In India, with over 60 million investors in stocks and mutual funds, a staggering 50% of individuals resort to personal loans to fulfill liquidity needs. When these investors need funds, they are faced with two unfavorable options: 1- Liquidating investments, which means losing out on the compounding growth of investments and also often incurring capital gains taxes of up to 35% 2- Taking out a personal loan at over 18% interest. Many investors have earmarked their investments for specific future needs, such as their child's education or their retirement.

Second, regulatory frameworks regarding lending and investment products differ substantially, requiring significant adaptation to comply with local laws and regulations in each target country. Third, cultural nuances regarding borrowing and investment practices must be considered, including trust in financial technology and comfort levels with digital lending platforms.

Collection agencies and law firms rely on thousands of staff and costly attorneys to handle tedious tasks like asset research, filing garnishments or liens, and following up with debtors or other involved parties. With over 70% of debt lawsuits ending in default judgments, these firms spend most of their time on repetitive, manual work with limited efficiency or data. This leads to lower recovery rates, higher costs, and a poor consumer experience. As a result, creditors lose billions annually in uncollected debts while incurring significantly higher collection costs. Debtors, in turn, pay more than they owe due to added legal and collection fees, making the debt resolution process both costly and stressful. The Solution CollectWise automates the entire late-stage debt collection process, enabling creditors to achieve 2X higher recovery rates while reducing costs by 50%. Our platform provides both creditors and debtors with a more efficient, cost-effective, and modern debt resolution experience. How It Works 1.

        "feasibility_analysis": "CollectWise faces a complex landscape in Latin America.  While the need for efficient debt collection is universal, several factors require careful consideration.  Market size varies significantly across countries; some have robust legal frameworks for debt recovery, while others have weaker enforcement mechanisms.  Cultural nuances around debt and communication are crucial; a direct, automated approach might be less effective than a more nuanced, human-centered strategy in certain regions.  Economic factors, such as levels of financial literacy and access to credit, also influence the potential market.  The legal and regulatory environments for debt collection differ substantially across Latin American countries, requiring careful legal navigation and potentially localized versions of the platform.  Furthermore, the technology's reliance on robust data infrastructure and sophisticated AI might present challenges in areas with limited connectivity or data availability.",

        "mvp": "Focus initially on a single, strategically selected Latin American country with a relatively stable legal and technological infrastructure (e.g., Chile, Mexico, or Colombia).  The MVP should prioritize a streamlined, human-in-the-loop approach.  Instead of fully automated AI-driven collection, start with AI-assisted tools that support human agents in tasks like asset research and communication scheduling, reducing manual workload and improving efficiency.  This allows testing the core value proposition (increased recovery rates and reduced costs) while adapting to local cultural nuances and legal requirements.  Partnerships with local debt collection agencies or law firms could prove invaluable for market access, regulatory compliance, and local expertise.  The MVP could be tested with a limited number of creditor clients and a subset of debt cases.  Close monitoring of key metrics (recovery rates, cost reductions, customer satisfaction) would inform further development and expansion to other markets."

We built an open source framework, runtime, and cloud that acknowledges this and removes these unnecessary layers from the development process. What?

No Express/API Routes/tRPC needed!  Coolest Side Effect: By building our tooling around Fullstack TypeScript, we enable full-stack feature packages, a way for JavaScript developers to package any feature they build and share it in a way that it can be embedded in other projects.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Freestyle's proposition of simplifying full-stack development with JavaScript is appealing, but its market adaptability in Latin America requires careful consideration. While JavaScript expertise is growing, the developer ecosystem, particularly for advanced frameworks, is less mature than in North America or Europe.  The target audience (developers) is relatively smaller compared to consumer-facing applications. Economic factors also play a role; many Latin American developers work on smaller projects or for companies with tighter budgets, making the adoption of a new framework a significant decision.  Cultural nuances are less impactful here, as the technical nature of the product transcends cultural barriers.

Before Resonance, he worked at DoorDash on a voice AI to automatically place customer orders over the phone. Prior to DoorDash, he worked at Dropbox to help build an internal in-product messaging platform that generated $100 million ARR. Prior to Dropbox, he worked at Microsoft helping build a platform that enabled doctors and patients to meet virtually using Microsoft Teams.Jonathan OuResonance\u00a0Company LaunchesResonance - Optimally upsell users within your product TL;DR:  Resonance is an ad server for house ads (self-promotional marketing). Companies use Resonance as a one-stop shop for campaign creation, intelligent experimentation/prioritization, analytics, and impression management to boost net revenue retention following user onboarding. Schedule a demo or get in contact.  The Team:  I used to work as a SWE at Dropbox, DoorDash, and Microsoft. In particular, I helped build a similar platform to Resonance at Dropbox that generated $100 million ARR. I wanted to start Resonance because 1) I felt there were many ways to improve that particular tool and 2) I wanted to bring that tool to other companies that need it but don\u2019t have the bandwidth to build it themselves.  The Problem:  For companies that depend on product-led growth (primarily consumer/SMB/startup-centric companies), their website remains their most valuable marketing channel. Post-user onboarding, these companies rely on in-product messaging to drive feature adoption so they can retain users. Unfortunately, this sort of strategy only works at scale, and there are many challenges in doing so. Below are some non-trivial functionalities that modern companies require to launch effective campaigns with velocity:  Code-based and no-code workflows for launching campaigns Campaign performance analytics Intelligent campaign targeting and experimentation Sophisticated campaign impression management UX flexibility (i.e. messaging should not be limited just to overlays)  Solving this problem is crucial, as millions in ARR is left on the table if companies cannot properly scale their in-product feature discovery/awareness/education. Companies like Dropbox that have built tooling to address the above challenges have generated up to $100 million ARR from the increased user retention.  The Solution:  Solving this problem requires building a centralized system where any stakeholder (technical or non-technical) can effortlessly launch campaigns to drive in-product feature adoption. Holistic assessment of campaign performance, global impression management, and optimized campaign targeting can only work at scale if there is a single system that serves as a repository for all campaigns and governs campaign creation. Resonance addresses this by providing a central platform where developers and non-developers can both easily launch in-product feature adoption campaigns within minutes, with the above functionalities provided out of the box. Below are screenshots of some important features in our UI (and there are many more).  No code builder with live preview on your website and experimentation  (NOTE: The preview will obviously be with your website and UI components - disregard my modal and website)       Complex User Targeting    Sophisticated Frequency Management  (NOTE: We also have similar rules that apply globally for all campaigns)      Global Analytics     Intelligent Experimentation (experiment up to 7x faster with 4-8x more variants)     Our Ask   If you are a product-led company, shipping a lot of features, or are using something like Intercom or Pendo, I\u2019d love to set up some time here to chat about improving your user retention.

The Problem It used to be easy to start texting with Twilio and other APIs, but after recent carrier compliance changes, you have to jump through hoops and piece together fragmented documentation to get registered. Then you still have to wait 2-3 weeks for approval before you can actually send messages.  The big SMS APIs are all now focused on big companies paying them millions of dollars per year. Startups are left with a terrible user experience, unresponsive email support, and a feeling of helplessness when trying to add SMS functionality to our applications. Our Solution  By incorporating the new compliance standards into our product from the beginning, Surge lets developers send texts without having to become experts on the registration process first. We provide white glove onboarding to get you through carrier registration or toll-free verification, and we can do it in 1-2 business days (sometimes even same day) instead of the typical 2-3 weeks. And we can get you up and running with a trial in minutes. Our intuitive REST API and webhooks are designed at a higher level of abstraction than other providers, which helps you simplify your application logic. And if you\u2019d rather write as little code as possible, we even have embeddable low-code UI components that make two-way texting a breeze to set up. On top of that, we offer responsive support to help you figure out any issues you have, no matter your size. Our Team Dennis and Brett are brothers who spent a combined 11 years at Podium (W16) where they worked on communications infrastructure for small businesses.

Anyone pursuing a work or immigrant visa will tell you about the difficulties of lottery systems, exorbitant fees, and endless paperwork. At Parley, we believe an important piece to fixing this process is automating work for immigration firms. For some visa types, a lawyer or legal writer spends several days writing a single application, learning about the most complex and technical professions, collating hundreds of pages of evidence, and synthesizing it all into a cohesive petition. Meanwhile, an applicant eagerly waits for their opportunity. By helping lawyers work better on a daily basis, we hope to accelerate Parley\u2019s speed to impact \u2014 reducing the complexity of immigration. \u270d\ufe0f The Solution Parley makes immigration processes easier. Our first product, the O-1A Writer, helps immigration attorneys speed write a petition while keeping them in the loop. As a lawyer does the critical thinking in specifying what argument they want to make, our writer dynamically pulls content from an applicant's evidence, fits that material to the context of the application, and automatically drafts a petition for review. We do this all directly in Microsoft Word \u2014 where most attorneys spend their time writing. We\u2019re quickly expanding support for more visa types like the H-1B, TN, EB-1, EB-2 NIW, L-1, and more.  Asks:  Want to use the product? Book a demo here. Been through a visa process?

Our drugs engage the immune system to aggressively fight tumors. In addition, our drugs have a unique delivery mechanism known as hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs). HAPs are drugs designed to become active in a hypoxic (low oxygen) environment, which is a hallmark of the majority of solid tumors.

We met working at the same lab at BYU when Evita was a Ph.D. student and Rachel was an undergrad. We collaborated on a peer-reviewed paper and conference presentations and we\u2019ve been friends since! Rachel went on to Dartmouth for her Ph.D. and later worked at a startup developing cell therapies. Evita went on for a postdoc and a career in drug development in big pharma.  Our Backstory Evita had noticed that a lot of good drugs couldn't make it past lead optimization due to toxicity concerns. The drugs were effective, just not safe. Rachel, working on cell therapies, noticed the same thing, some therapies were efficacious but systemic toxicity was a stumbling block. That's when we started to explore strategies to make therapeutics safer and reduce systemic toxicity, and Eris Biotech was born. The Problem Cancer therapies are terrible! It\u2019s a race between who kills you first: the therapeutic or the cancer. At Eris Biotech, we want to help with that, starting with mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that grows on the pleura, the thin layer surrounding the lungs, with a 5-year survival rate of <13%. Current mesothelioma treatments not only fall short in effectiveness but are also systemically toxic, and most patients diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within 14 months after diagnosis. Our Solution Eris Biotech develops drugs that only activate under low oxygen (hypoxic) environments. These drugs are referred to as hypoxia-activated prodrugs or HAPs. A low oxygen or hypoxic environment is a hallmark of the majority of solid tumors, including mesothelioma, and healthy tissues are usually not hypoxic. By delivering active drugs only to the tumor site, we can use more potent drugs without systemic toxicity in cancer therapeutics. To develop our first HAP, we used AI drug discovery tools and AI-designed compounds from a library of over 2.6 million compounds. Our first HAP in development blocks the communication between the tumor and its surroundings. This lack of communication isolates tumors from essential resources, and engages the immune system to aggressively fight tumors.

I\u2019m Dhaval Gajiwala, the founder of\u00a0NowHouse. \ud83d\udd11 tl;dr NowHouse builds software that helps stock brokerages settle trades instantly. We\u2019re starting by helping trading ops teams in the brokerage back office intelligently reconcile trades and corporate actions. \ud83d\udcf1 Setting the scene Many of you acutely recall quarantining at home in January 2021, nearly a year after the pandemic started. If you\u2019re anything like me, you passed a lot of time switching between the same three or four apps on your phone amid curfews and indoor dining bans. If one of those apps was a brokerage, you might also recall this headline.  Two weeks after the\u00a0WallStreetBets-driven surge in the price of GME started, Robinhood restricted trading, drawing the ire of its users. When a stock is as volatile as GME was, the\u00a0NSCC increases its collateral requirement to ensure it can continue to bear counterparty risk and clear the trades sent its way. As a result, Robinhood restricted buying to avoid becoming insolvent. \ud83c\udfe6 So what? One of the things Robinhood had to do was reconcile, or match, its trades against its executing brokers and ultimately against those cleared by the NSCC. In fact, every firm has to reconcile trades against the firm immediately upstream in the state machine below\u2014it\u2019s a well-conserved pattern.  For example, at market open, an introducing broker reconciles the previous day\u2019s close against its carrying broker, which in turn reconciles against its clearing broker. Similarly, the clearing broker reconciles against trades reported via\u00a0UTC\u00a0by the\u00a0DTC, which holds $87 trillion of securities. (You can think of the DTC as the custodian\u2019s custodian.) The DTC itself receives settlement instructions from the NSCC via the\u00a0CNS\u00a0system, which nets transactions to one security position per firm per day. Member firms are\u00a0also\u00a0apprised of securities movements by the NSCC via CNS. A given brokerage may even reconcile its own orders against partial fills or its settled shares against shares that are pending, held, or tradable. The point is that\u00a0the 20 billion equity and options trades in the US every year are each netted and reconciled several times over at different levels of abstraction in the financial system. At a single firm, reconciliation is done thousands of times per day across hundreds of thousands of trades. \ud83d\udcc8 Technically speaking \u2026reconciliation is the process of creating as \u201cgood\u201d a mapping as possible between disjoint subsets of two ordered or unordered finite sets. It\u2019s a generalization of the subset sum problem, which is itself NP-complete. The size of the search space for reconciliation is given by the Bell numbers, a logarithmically convex sequence that counts the partitions of a set. Reconciliation can be constrained by, for example, enforcing that set partitions are non-crossing. Even then, however, the search space is given by the Catalan numbers, another logarithmically convex sequence. This means that\u00a0the fastest general solution is exhaustive search\u2014unacceptable for 100 trades, let alone 100,000\u2026 \ud83d\uddc2 \u2026so how does reconciliation work today? It\u2019s done by people. Even at the most tech-forward brokerages and clearinghouses, reconciliation is manually driven. In some cases, it\u2019s naively automated\u2014think\u00a0cron jobs executing stored procedures\u2014which is far less robust than human judgement. These procedures are slow and brittle. And whether it's driven by a trading ops team alone or augmented by computers, there's little variance in how reconciliation is done from firm to firm. It\u2019s the same problem across the 3,400 SEC-registered broker-dealers. \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udcbb How does NowHouse fix this? To make this problem tractable, it needs to have a clear objective function and be constrained with heuristics. NowHouse preprocesses and normalizes trading datasets using AI,\u00a0reconciles trades under context-appropriate objective functions, and writes reconciled transactions to a general ledger. It also enforces configurable constraints, like adjacency of transactions in a match so that the reconciliations it generates make sense given different business contexts. A trading ops associate need not waste time manually combing through reams of transactions to resolve discrepant ones. \ud83d\udd53 Why now? You\u2019ve probably noticed that when you place a trade, the shares (or cash) take two business days to arrive, at which point you can sell the shares (or withdraw the cash). That's known as T+2 settlement, and it\u2019s about to change. Just over a year ago, the SEC adopted\u00a0amendments\u00a0to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\u00a0shortening the trade settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1. Maintaining current books and records is paramount to supporting T+1 settlement, and efficiently reconciling trades is paramount to maintaining current books and records. \ud83d\udcdd The vision \u2026is to become the\u00a0de facto system of record to firms and their regulators on the 3 trillion shares that change hands in U.S. markets every year. This will then enable NowHouse to shoulder compliance and recordkeeping responsibilities like\u00a0CAT reporting\u00a0for brokerages. \ud83c\udf06 My request If you work (or worked) for a brokerage, clearinghouse, or any other party involved in the trade lifecycle, please reach out\u2014especially if your firm wrestles with trade clearing and settlement.  Christmas at the NYSE, taken a block from my apartment, and a week before flying to SF for YC. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "NowHouse's solution, while innovative in its approach to trade reconciliation, faces significant challenges in the Latin American market.  The target market (stock brokerages) is smaller in Latin America compared to the US, and the level of technological sophistication and regulatory frameworks vary considerably across countries.  Many smaller brokerages might rely on manual processes, making the adoption of a sophisticated AI-driven solution difficult.  Furthermore, the prevalence of less-developed technological infrastructure in some regions could hinder implementation.  Cultural nuances related to risk aversion and trust in new technologies must also be considered.  Economic factors, such as the relative lower trading volumes compared to developed markets, may limit the potential market size and revenue generation for NowHouse. A phased approach focusing on larger, more technologically advanced brokerages in specific countries with well-developed capital markets (e.g., Mexico, Brazil, Colombia) would be crucial.",

We keep your compliance paperwork up to date and escalate issues that need attention so that your engineers can focus on more critical work. The Problem  Burn-out: Many companies struggle to complete in-depth security reviews\u00a0due to understaffed teams. The industry average is 1 security engineer per 200 software engineers. There is an overwhelming volume of software and policies to monitor and cross-check. Fragmentation: Today, a typical enterprise security review takes\u00a03-4\u00a0months\u00a0to complete. Most of that time is spent gathering information and filling out paperwork. Trust teams operate in silos, leading to redundant questions or delayed risk identification.  Our Solution  Triage: Review all designs and code for security best practices and regulatory compliance.  Raise the Ceiling: Prioritize which applications need deeper review by security & privacy engineers. Raise the Floor: For the rest, perform baseline security & privacy reviews to ensure compliance.   Shift Left: Bring the collective knowledge of legal, privacy, compliance, and security teams directly to developers from the inception of their work. Continuous Monitoring: Real-time, automated checks instead of point-in-time reviews.   Our Ask Reach out to us if:  Your security/privacy teams are understaffed and overwhelmed.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Clearly AI's automated security and privacy review service presents a significant opportunity in Latin America, but success hinges on adapting to the region's unique context.  Market size is substantial, as larger companies in the region are increasingly adopting international security standards and facing growing regulatory pressure (like LGPD in Brazil). However, the smaller businesses that constitute a large part of the Latin American economy might not have the resources or perceived need for such a specialized service initially. Cultural nuances are important; a strong emphasis on trust and building relationships with clients will be crucial for adoption. Economic factors, especially varying levels of digital infrastructure and cybersecurity maturity across countries, require a phased rollout. Focusing initially on larger corporations in more digitally advanced countries (e.g., Chile, Mexico, Brazil) is a practical strategy.  The solution needs to be bilingual (Spanish and Portuguese) and offer flexible pricing models to address varying budgets.",

Our current mission: empower healthcare practices to stop denials and under-billing on their claims before they happen. The Problem Healthcare claims processing is an overly-complex, adversarial space. Insurance payers are constantly changing their policies, forcing billing teams to rely on:  frequent and extensive retraining coding rules worksheets with hundreds of tabs esoteric tribal knowledge  With so much room for human error, it\u2019s no wonder 73% of healthcare staff surveyed reported that they\u2019re facing increasing denials on outgoing claims. A turnkey solution for medical claims checks Here\u2019s where Chorrie comes in.   Chorrie uses AI to empower medical practices to turn their esoteric knowledge into automated checks, saving time, money, and mental effort. We take simple, deterministic instructions, and translate them into a code-based decision tree, which can be continuously run to automate correctness checks for complex rules systems. Take the example in our video: we get a glimpse at how extensive these rules worksheets can become today, and see how quick & easy it is to automate a rule for claims from a particular location, containing a particular code, billed to a particular insurance payer with Chorrie. Backstops-as-a-service Our approach of plaintext \u27a1\ufe0f decision tree \u27a1\ufe0f code generation is a scalable technique that can be used to provide backstop checks (and ultimately automate) high-leverage, deterministic manual processes that are prone to human error (think contract review for legal documents, trade confirmations, etc.). To automate checks for these today, you\u2019d need a team of engineers to write the logic into code, and keep them on staff to ensure that code can be updated when the rules change. With Chorrie, you get:  A no-code solution: turn your SMEs into SWEs No hallucinations in your automated workflows Intrinsically deterministic & fully explainable conclusions  While the focus today is on reducing claims denials to 0% for our healthcare clients, we plan to explore use cases in other fields in the future.

Imagine being able to prompt Minecraft, The Sims, or Animal Crossing into existence.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLpG4LrLf60   Why Now? The advent of large language models and diffusion models presents an incredible opportunity to solve three seemingly intractable problems in open-world games and simulations:  It is hard for humans to write code and script interactions between assets, characters, and the environment to design fun games and experiences It was impossible for NPCs to display human-like behavior and have true agency in these 3D worlds It is hard to create new 3D assets, worlds, and non-playable characters  We founded ego to build an AI native simulation engine to solve all three problems - and we\u2019ve started by tackling the first two. ego is an AI-native simulation/game engine and platform where users can create and share 3D animated characters, worlds, and scripted interactions all using natural language. Imagine being able to prompt games like GTA, The Sims, Minecraft, or Animal Crossing into existence. In the age of Gen AI, it is finally possible to build a game engine that is also a game. Simulations on ego Over the course of YC, we built and launched two experimental games with our simulation engine: TownWorld (a 3D simulation of the Stanford Generative Agents paper - tweet thread) and CharacterIdol (a game where user-prompted generative agents compete to entertain American Idol-style judges\u2026also powered by LLMs). All of the character personalities, conversations, memories, and routines/movements in these games are fully generated by AI. Townworld:   CharacterIdol:   This is where we found the massive opportunity to meaningfully make progress toward our vision of gaining usage of our simulation engine - making it really easy for a user to make and share a game featuring agents in bounded or unbounded 3D space. We are keenly aware of the sheer amount of time users spend talking to character.ai characters, as well as the sheer amount of time young creators spend learning Lua code to script simple games and experiences in Roblox. What if we enable humans to interact with agents in immersive 3D worlds without the creators themselves needing to write complex Lua scripts or learn 3D modeling? What if summoning an agent was as simple as filling out a DnD character sheet? Why is this a big deal? Since time immemorial, humans have built tools to bring their internal worlds to life. The sandbox, the dollhouse, a tree branch shaped like a rifle - all examples of tools we use to bolster our imaginative capacity to dream new worlds, characters, scenarios, and stories into existence. The closest we\u2019ve come as a species to actualizing our imagination has been through the use of game engines to create simulated open-world experiences and games. AI is about to democratize the strongest tool we\u2019ve had to realize our imaginations, and ego will be the simulation platform and engine that will power this new possibility. Animal Crossing, The Sims, Garry\u2019s Mod, Skyrim, Minecraft, Roblox, and GTA - all hit games that empower players to explore, create, and roleplay in immersive 3D worlds. However, video games are hard to build and even harder to keep releasing fresh content for.

We are working with our first cohort of health insurance brokers to help them save the, on average, 6 hours of manual data entry they do every week.Blume BenefitsFounded:2023Team Size:3Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Surbhi Sarna\u00a0Former FoundersAditya JoshiHey! I am Aditya Joshi. I grew up in Wichita, Kansas and have been interested in healthcare since I was 13. I've had the opportunity to work in clinics, labs, hospital systems, and an insurance carrier. Now, I'm excited to be exploring and building for a new, but deeply interesting, facet of the ecosystem: health insurance brokerages.Aditya JoshiBlume Benefits\u00a0\u00a0Ethan HouCTO @ MartinEthan HouBlume Benefits\u00a0Varun VermaBuilding for health insurance brokers at Blume.Varun VermaBlume Benefits\u00a0\u00a0Company Launches\ud83c\udf3b Blume: Back Office Automation for Health Insurance BrokersHey everyone! We\u2019re Aditya, Ethan, and Varun building Blume Benefits.  TL;DR \ud83d\udccc Blume Benefits automates health insurance sales for brokers. Today, health insurance brokers spend an average of 11 hours a week on manual data entry. Blume helps brokers manage quotes, renewals, and revenue ops all in one place without having to manually enter a single keystroke of data. The Problem \u274c Obtaining health insurance is such a complex task that a $104 billion-dollar industry exists to help employers navigate the buying, negotiating, and administering of health insurance for their employees. Health insurance brokers, the stewards of these transactions, have to manage thousands of complex relationships every year. From negotiating commissions and quotes with insurance carriers to managing contract renewals and compliance for their clients, health insurance brokers find themselves using a fragmented set of programs to store and manage all of this information. Constantly, data and reminders fall through the cracks resulting in thousands of dollars in lost commissions, botched renewals, and an artificially capped book of business. The Solution \u2728 Blume was created to streamline the relationships that brokers have to manage with their clients and the insurance carriers they work with. On Blume, brokers can:  Turn unstructured quotes into presentable and understandable formats for their clients. Automate insurance carrier commission statement reconciliation and revenue recovery. Consolidate information about their customers to prioritize their work, ensure no clients are left underserved, and catch problems with plan designs before employees run into them in the clinic.  By consolidating all of these tools, we are building toward a world where health insurance brokers spend all of their time helping their clients navigate the complex world of health insurance rather than manually keying in data to Excel, spending hours every week consolidating claims data into actionable insights. Why we built Blume \ud83d\udcbc Over the last few months, we had the opportunity to speak with more than 150 health insurance brokers. One thing was clear, they all were frustrated with the decreasing amount of time they could spend helping their clients due to the growing administrative burden and knew that something had to change. When we set out to find existing solutions to their problems, we saw user interfaces that hadn\u2019t changed in years, manual workflows that increased reporting responsibilities for brokers, and software built to be sold to agency executives, not to be used by individual brokers. We are excited to address these issues with Blume. Our ask \ud83d\udc4b We\u2019re looking to connect with health insurance brokers looking to grow their book of business. If you are one, know any, or can connect us to yours, please feel free to reach out at founders@blumebenefits.com. ",

The core value proposition \u2013 automating administrative tasks for health insurance brokers \u2013 is universally relevant, addressing a common pain point of efficiency and time management. However, several factors need careful consideration. Market size varies significantly across Latin American countries; some have robust private health insurance sectors (e.g., Mexico, Colombia, Chile), while others rely more on public systems.  Cultural nuances around technology adoption and trust in digital solutions must be addressed. Economic factors like the average cost of health insurance and the size of brokerages will affect market penetration.  The existing digital infrastructure and internet penetration will also influence implementation.

We first developed this API for a very specific use case in supply chain and got it to work across various unstructured documents used in the field. We were simply unable to find another solution on the market that worked well. Our original plan was to keep it in-house, but we soon started getting requests from dozens of companies to use this API on their own. \u274c The Problem Most enterprise data is unstructured, making it difficult to parse with LLMs Approximately 75% of enterprise data is unstructured, the majority of this is directly within PDF files. This makes it extremely difficult to build RAG applications with this data, and ingestion is often the bottleneck. Current solutions are slow, inaccurate, and expensive We personally tested nearly every other tool on the market and found they lack accurate contextual understanding, multi-column PDFs, and multimodal documents.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Presti AI presents a compelling proposition for the Latin American furniture market.  The market size, while potentially smaller than in developed nations, offers significant opportunity for growth. Many Latin American furniture businesses are SMEs (small and medium enterprises) that may lack resources for expensive traditional photography.  Presti's AI-driven solution can offer a cost-effective alternative, aligning with the need for efficiency and reduced expenses.  However, cultural nuances need consideration.  Visual preferences and styles vary across Latin American countries; ensuring the AI model adapts to these variations is crucial for success. Internet penetration and digital adoption vary widely across regions, requiring a phased rollout strategy targeting areas with higher digital maturity.  Economic factors, especially exchange rates and payment processing, need careful attention.  Successful implementation will depend on effective localization of the platform (language, currency, payment options) and robust customer support in Spanish.",

A free trial with limited usage for a specific timeframe would allow gathering early feedback, refining the model's understanding of local aesthetic preferences, and identifying any technical or cultural barriers to adoption.  The feedback loop should focus on usability and the quality of the generated images according to local tastes, leading to iterative improvements before a wider regional rollout."

I've spent the past 9 years building cloud storage products at AWS and Netflix, and I'm thrilled that teams can finally stop managing disks.Hunter LeathRegatta Storage\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesRegatta Storage: Transform S3 into an infinite, local file systemTL;DR:\u00a0 Regatta Storage transforms S3 buckets into infinite, local file systems. It\u2019s 30x faster than accessing S3 directly, and 90% cheaper than manually managing EBS disks. Regatta provides instant access to data in S3, and it powers AI applications that can\u2019t wait for massive data sets to download. Regatta doesn\u2019t require code changes because it\u2019s just a file system. You can try it today at regattastorage.com. I\u2019m Hunter, the founder of Regatta Storage. I\u2019ve spent the past 9 years building cloud storage products on the frontier of what\u2019s possible \u2013 leading both Amazon\u2019s Elastic File System product and Netflix\u2019s cloud storage team. During this time, I worked with thousands of application developers, cloud teams, and software providers to deeply understand how they use storage. Here's the problem: I found that AI and analytics teams love storing their data in S3 because it\u2019s low-cost and scalable, but their applications can only use this data once it\u2019s in a local file system. As a result, these teams are constantly moving data back and forth from their local instance file systems to S3. For larger data sets, applications can wait for hours to download and decompress data before starting. Unlike S3, local file systems have a limited amount of capacity that you can\u2019t easily change after creation, they don\u2019t support sharing data, and they\u2019re 10x more expensive. Regatta transforms your existing S3 buckets into a new kind of infinite, local file system. With Regatta, your applications can instantly use petabyte-scale data sets in S3 without waiting for manual data download. Regatta automatically scales with your data, and you only pay for the data you\u2019re actively using \u2013 90% cheaper than using EBS. With Regatta\u2019s shared, high-speed cache, all your instances and containers can take advantage of 30x faster, consistent reads and writes. When you\u2019re done editing data, it automatically flows back to S3 within a few minutes, so you can easily share results with teammates. Regatta has full POSIX compatibility (including renames, appends, and locking), so it\u2019s already compatible with your applications \u2013 no code changes needed. Teams move faster when they use Regatta because they don\u2019t have to build custom data movement infrastructure. Check out how easy Regatta is to set up and use.   We are really excited about how Regatta will help teams simplify their data management. We are currently working with: AI teams who want to start model inference without waiting for downloads to complete, researchers who want to experiment on models and create new versions without running out of disk capacity, analytics teams who want to speed up their batch pipelines, and cloud teams who want lower-cost local storage without worrying about utilization. We\u2019d love to work with you, too. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at hleath@regattastorage.com. You can try Regatta today by signing up at regattastorage.com. Let\u2019s build the future of the cloud together.  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Regatta Storage faces a significant challenge in the Latin American market. While the need for efficient data storage and access is universal, the target audience (AI teams, researchers, analytics teams, and cloud teams) is relatively small compared to consumer-focused applications.  The high technical expertise required to use and understand the product limits its market adaptability.  Furthermore, the prevalence of smaller, resource-constrained businesses in many Latin American countries may make the cost-effectiveness argument less compelling compared to larger enterprises in more developed economies. Economic factors also play a crucial role; the cost of cloud services and reliable internet access can be higher in some regions, influencing the adoption rate. Cultural nuances are less relevant, as the product is technical and broadly applicable.  Focusing on specific niches within larger organizations in more developed Latin American countries might be a more viable approach initially.",

The MVP would involve a simplified onboarding process tailored to this niche, focusing on ease of use and clear demonstration of the performance benefits.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Carma's B2B model focusing on same-day commercial fleet repairs presents a significant opportunity in Latin America.  The market size is substantial, considering the growth of logistics and delivery services across the region. However, several cultural and economic factors need careful consideration.  Trust and established relationships are crucial in many Latin American markets, requiring a robust vetting process for service centers and building confidence among fleet owners.  The economic disparity across the region means targeting specific countries or cities with higher disposable income and a developed automotive repair infrastructure is crucial initially.  The high cost of vehicle repairs and the lack of transparency are pain points that Carma addresses effectively, making it potentially attractive, but penetration requires thoughtful localized marketing.  Adapting the app to Spanish-speaking markets and incorporating local payment methods is essential.  The presence of informal repair shops will present a significant hurdle; therefore, a strong vetting mechanism is crucial for maintaining the credibility of the platform and ensuring quality service.",

The MVP should feature a simplified Spanish-language app for fleet owners to request services, connect with a smaller, pre-vetted network of trusted local service centers, and handle transactions securely using popular local payment methods.  This MVP should focus on a narrow set of common repair needs.  Gather data on user experience, service center feedback, and cost savings.  Iterate based on this initial data, gradually expanding to other cities and repair services after validating the core concept."

At the core of my work is a passion for creating impactful products that address real-world challenges in vital sectors.Efren A. Lamoldamdhub\u00a0\u00a0Company Launchesmdhub - Clinical AI assistant for mental health clinicstl;dr Instead of seeing patients, mental health clinicians spend 50% of their time on other tasks, delaying access to mental health care. We aim to help them become 10x more efficient with our clinical AI assistant by automating tasks that keep them from seeing more patients. Since our launch 6 months ago, we successfully saved clinicians more than 100,000 hours in admin tasks, enabling them to generate tens of millions in additional revenue. Our Story We are Dominik and Efren, and we are on a mission to make mental healthcare accessible and affordable for everyone, everywhere. Efren holds an MSc in Computer Science and has been passionate about leveraging technology to improve health outcomes and has extensive experience building products. Dom holds a Masters in Management from London Business School and started his career at BCG. Our joint journey started in 2018 at a hyperscale start-up, where Efren joined as a founding engineer and Dom as the first hands-on operator. Since then, we have been building products together. As mental health challenges rise globally, we're committed to being at the forefront of innovation, leveraging AI and data to improve lives and transform care.  The Problem Mental health issues are a growing concern in America, with approximately 50 million Americans currently grappling with a mental health condition. Alarmingly, this number is increasing by 1.5 million each year. Concurrently, the US is on track to face a shortfall of 30,000 mental health clinicians by 2024, a situation that's already costing the US health system $300 billion annually due to delayed treatment. In a world where time is of the essence, clinicians are spending only 50% of their day with patients, while the rest is consumed by tasks like clinical documentation, dealing with insurance, and other back-office heavy work. Our Solution We power mental health clinicians with mdhub\u2019s clinical AI assistant, enabling them to focus on patient care. The patient-clinician conversation is at the core of mental health treatment, and by capturing it, our clinical AI assistant can automate tasks that prevent clinicians from dedicating more time to patients, such as writing clinical documentation, drafting patient after-visit reports, pre-charting, and treatment planning. We are particularly excited about receiving daily appreciation from our users. \u201c\u2026I absolutely love the software.\u201d Female, Psychotherapist, Montana. \u201c\u2026You have a dynamite product. I am so happy I came across you guys.\u201d Female, Psychotherapist, Nevada. \u201c\u2026Instead of an hour of paperwork at the end of the day I\u2019m wrestling with my kids, well worth it!\u201d Male, Psychiatrist, Minnesota. \u201c\u2026It is truly such a great help - I am currently actually near burnout and going down on FTE for this year because of notes, and your program has given me some hope, actually!\u201d Male, Psychiatrist, Texas. The Future We Are Building We believe running a more efficient practice is just the first step. In the future we are building, we will empower clinicians to start and grow their practices, bringing us closer to our mission of making mental health accessible and affordable for everyone and everywhere.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Argon AI's platform faces significant challenges in the Latin American market.  While the need for efficient drug development intelligence is universal, the market size for sophisticated AI-driven solutions within the biopharma sector in Hispanic countries is considerably smaller than in North America or Europe.  The limited number of large pharmaceutical companies and research institutions in the region reduces the potential customer base.  Furthermore, language barriers (while the platform may offer Spanish support, the nuances of technical terminology could pose issues) and the need for local regulatory compliance will add complexity. Economic factors also play a crucial role; the high cost of Argon AI's platform might be a barrier to adoption in many Latin American countries.

Today, clinicians spend thousands of hours manually pulling complex facts out of medical records for mandatory reporting and quality improvement.  Our AI pulls those facts out of unstructured medical records automatically. We automate reporting and show staff where avoidable patient harm is happening.PharosFounded:2024Team Size:3Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Jared Friedman\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersFelix Brann, FounderCEO at Pharos.

Obsessed with sepsis: https://ai.jmir.org/2024/1/e49784Felix BrannPharos\u00a0\u00a0Matthew Jones, FounderFounder and CTO at Pharos. Previously I was part of the founding team of Market2x, a rural trucking SAAS startup, growing that from inception to international expansion. The rest of my career has been as a software engineer at various health tech companies.Matthew JonesPharos\u00a0Company Launches\ud83c\udfe5 Pharos - Automate reporting and prevent patient harm with AItl;dr: The data hospital teams need to improve patient safety is buried in unstructured medical records. Today, clinicians spend thousands of hours manually \u2018abstracting\u2019 it for reporting and analysis. We automate the entire process and use the data to show them where and why avoidable harm is happening. Hi folks! We\u2019re Felix and Matthew, and we\u2019re building Pharos.  The problem: Avoidable harm happens in hospitals all the time. Wards are busy, clinician turnover is high, and an aging population means increasingly complex patients. Sepsis alone kills 350,000 patients a year in the US, and a significant number of those deaths are preventable. Hospitals have teams dedicated to preventing harm. They track avoidable events, identify the process failures that cause them, and report performance data to clinical registries. This means identifying harm events, risk factors and process adherence from patient journeys composed of pages of unstructured clinical notes. Today, this is an entirely manual process. Producing structured quality metrics from a single complex patient case can take up to 8 hours of clinical time. A single hospital can spend $5m per year extracting this data, and it still arrives weeks after discharge, on a small sample of their patients. The solution: Our AI extracts the data quality teams need from every patient record in real-time. It produces verifiable quality metrics, with references into the original medical record.  We use this data to:  Automate reporting for clinical registries and value-based reimbursement contracts, saving thousands of clinical hours. Identify and surface process failures that are contributing to patient harm, letting teams take action on issues like sepsis, hospital-acquired\u00a0infections, and pressure ulcers. Measure the impact of quality improvement projects in real-time rather than months after implementation.  Why us? Felix and Matthew spent the past 5 years deploying patient and clinician-facing AI into over 70 hospitals together. As VP of Data Science, Felix published papers in major medical journals on sepsis prediction and medical record summarization using LLMs. Matthew has years of experience integrating software into EHRs and previously built another startup from inception to international expansion. Alex joined the team after working as a doctor in the UK and then as a medical AI researcher at Imperial College London and Meta\u2019s Reality Labs. He experienced this problem firsthand, spending years of his residency frustrated at the manual abstraction required for quality improvement. We believe enabling quality teams with AI represents a huge opportunity to save lives and prevent harm. Our ask: Please reach out to felix@pharos.health if you know the following people!  Anyone working at a senior level at a US hospital (we\u2019ll ask them for an intro to their quality team) Anyone working in healthcare with a title that includes \u201cQuality\u201d, \u201cPatient Safety,\u201d or \u201c(Sepsis, Stroke, \u2026) Coordinator\u201d Academics and clinicians working at the intersection of data and clinical quality  Hear from the foundersHow did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)Felix and Matthew worked together for nearly 5 years at Vital.io, a company deploying AI models into hospitals. While piloting clinical adoption of a predictive sepsis model, they realized that enabling quality staff with AI represents a huge opportunity to improve patient outcomes. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?We believe in a future where AI catches medical mistakes everywhere in the hospital, before they become serious. We want to be the lighthouse for our hospitals, supporting clinicians and reducing patient harm. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Pharos's AI-powered hospital reporting automation presents a significant opportunity in Latin America, but requires careful adaptation.  The market size is considerable, given the growing need for improved healthcare efficiency and quality across the region. However, the implementation faces challenges.  Many hospitals in Latin America lack the robust electronic health record (EHR) systems prevalent in the US, which are crucial for Pharos's AI to function effectively.  The level of digitalization varies significantly across countries, with some lagging behind in technological infrastructure.  Cultural nuances, such as differences in medical record-keeping practices and language variations, need to be addressed.  Economic factors, particularly budget constraints in public hospitals, could limit adoption. A tiered pricing strategy, focusing on value-driven ROI narratives, may be necessary. The solution needs to be adapted to work with existing (and often less advanced) EHR systems, possibly including manual data entry integration as an initial stage, focusing on the most impactful quality indicators tailored to prevalent issues within the region.  A phased rollout starting with private hospitals in more developed countries within Latin America would be more feasible initially.",

This allows for a controlled test environment and reduces initial technical challenges.  The MVP would involve adapting the AI to work with the hospital's existing EHR system (or potentially creating an easy-to-use data import system) to automate reporting for the chosen area.  Focus should be on a small number of key metrics, ensuring data accuracy and providing clear, actionable insights to hospital staff. This would include creating Spanish-language reports and user interfaces and potentially adding support for local medical terminology. Post-MVP, iterative development would focus on addressing issues identified during the initial testing and expanding to other hospitals and clinical areas."

        "feasibility_analysis": "Praxis AI's solution presents a significant opportunity in Latin America, but requires careful consideration.  The market size for manufacturing optimization is substantial, particularly in countries with established industrial sectors (e.g., Mexico, Brazil, Colombia). However, the adoption rate will depend on factors like digital maturity within factories, budgetary constraints, and the prevalence of English-speaking personnel.  Cultural nuances need to be addressed; the solution's user interface and support materials should be available in Spanish, and implementation strategies should account for diverse communication styles and decision-making processes.  Economic factors, including the cost of deploying and maintaining the solution, and the potential ROI for manufacturers, will be key selling points. Focusing initially on larger, more technologically advanced manufacturers in specific countries could be a smart strategy before scaling to smaller companies.",

Excited about transforming the landscape of engineering simulations with new technology that combines physics, experimental data and AI.Chuck KorogluDeepSim, Inc.\u00a0Company LaunchesDeepSim \u2013 AI physics simulationsTLDR: AI-accelerated 3D physics simulator for engineers DeepSim makes it easy for engineers to run 3D physics simulations fast. This means rapid design iterations for better products and real-world monitoring for better decisions. We built a new physics simulation platform that leverages AI physics models for very fast, ultra-scalable physics simulations. \u2014 Hi everyone! We are Connor, Alex, and Chuck, and we love physics simulations. While working on our PhDs at Stanford, we saw how physics simulators needed a refresh to solve modern problems. That\u2019s why we started DeepSim. The Problem Running 3D physics simulations is difficult, expensive, and slow.  Setup: Experienced engineers still spend countless hours meshing their designs before even running a single simulation. Run: Many simulations take hours to even weeks on expensive compute systems. Some are even intractable and require highly trained engineers to simplify the problems at a significant cost of accuracy. Attention: Each step requires constant babysitting as simulators are fragile and can fail at any time.  \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd27\ufe0f Engineers hate the tedious simulation setup and wasted time due to failed simulations. \ud83d\udc54 Managers hate that engineers can\u2019t go faster and use tons of cloud credits. \ud83d\udcb0 CEOs/VPs hate that engineering delays stall a product launch. The Solution Leverage AI to simplify, speed up, and scale up 3D physics simulations. We are building a new AI physics simulation platform, automating away the physics setup and simulating designs 1000X faster with no drop in accuracy. Our platform uses lightweight, easy-to-train AI models combined with a powerful GPU-accelerated solver to deliver solutions quickly and efficiently. This approach eliminates the bulkiness of traditional finite element method (FEM) tools and overcomes the inflexibility of other AI physics simulators.  At DeepSim, we have already worked with semiconductor companies to build the most powerful thermal simulator for circuit design, running thermal simulations with billions of nodes in minutes on a single GPU, which is 1000X more detail than a commercial tool can deliver using 50+ CPU cores in the same amount of time. With DeepSim's simulator, we are able to model extremely complex geometries with length scales spanning 6 orders of magnitude, intractable to solve with FEM tools. Below is a thermal simulation of an integrated circuit, complete with a heat sink and airflow, that only took 10 minutes to run. We can resolve hot spots in individual transistors (~10 nm in size) within a whole chip (1 cm).  Use Cases This is a breakthrough in 3D physics simulations that empowers engineers in the same way FEM did 50 years ago. We\u2019re excited to see where engineers take our tool! Some initial use cases are:  Speeding up the design of complex systems with faster simulations Utilizing design automation to speed up development Developing digital twins for system operation  The Team  Chuck, Alex, and Connor founded DeepSim to solve the frustrating parts of their PhDs.

We're building Dispatch: An OS which allows different types of satellites to work together, and produces optimized instructions for fleets of spacecraft. The company is founded by Max Bhatti and Alex Choi, lead engineers at the MIT CubeSat program. Previously, the duo worked as systems engineers at SpaceX, and the UK Ministry of Defense. Basalt Tech recently received its seed investment as part of the Y Combinator W24 batch, and is currently in technical development.Basalt TechFounded:2023Team Size:2Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Michael Seibel\u00a0Active FoundersMaximillian Bhatti, FounderCEO & Co-Founder of Basalt Tech    //   I was working at Caltech\u2019s fusion lab when I was hired out of highschool by my co-founder Alex. We would spend the next year working together at MIT AeroAstro, and become great friends in the process.   Since then, I\u2019ve spent stints at The Aerospace Corporation and SpaceX working on distributed space systems and the American moon landing. Most recently, I dropped out to build Basalt Tech with Alex. My hobbies include hiking and buying infinite whiteboards.Maximillian BhattiBasalt Tech\u00a0Alex Choi, FounderCOO & Co-Founder of Basalt Tech  Previously, I worked as an aerospace engineer at the UK M.O.D. and project manager at MIT AeroAstro, leading the development of novel spacecraft missions. Specialties include embedded systems, radios, distributed information systems, and aerothermodynamics. I also worked on a master\u2019s on engineering design with Indigenous communities before leaving to build Basalt.   My hobbies include cooking food and playing video games!Alex ChoiBasalt Tech\u00a0Company LaunchesBasalt Tech - Windows for Spacecrafthttps://basalt.space Windows for Spacecraft: Basalt Dispatch  Fig 1. - Dispatch simulation engine based on open source NASA code. The graphics have room for improvement! Dispatch is the first satellite OS. It provides a common software infrastructure to allows fleets of dissimilar satellites to work together:  Tasking: Image geographic areas in visible, infrared, or radar. Radio and Telecom: Manage in-orbit networks and signals intelligence collection. Orbital Security: Monitor and inspect other space assets.  New or external software modules can also easily be integrated, rather than being rewritten for each individual satellite. There are over 65,000 satellites licensed to be launched by 2030. That\u2019s over $100B of assets whose value comes from the bytes of data they send down. Right now, that data pipeline includes email, whiteboards, and Excel. Dispatch is here to change that, and bring autonomy into orbit, for every mission. Background Flight operations still rely on manual processes and highly custom software. While this is acceptable for single, high-value missions, the need to manage large, flexible satellite fleets challenges that status quo.  Fig 2 - ESA Visualization of active and defunct satellites around Earth. This type of modular software infrastructure has been implemented in-house before, usually on specific hardware. (Think individual custom OS\u2019s before Windows.) Right now, there is no solution for space companies or government agencies other than to take on massive in-house development, or scale up their operations staff. This is the story we\u2019ve heard over and over talking to flight directors and CEOs. The innovation Dispatch brings is its universality - Dispatch allows this functionality to be brought to any space asset out-of-the-box. Recent Progress  Fig 3 - Alex and Max at the National University of Singapore. We are beginning an effort to revive one of their satellites with our software. One month ago we wrote our first line of code. Today, after 2 weeks of travel, we have kicked off collaborations with some of the leading space systems institutions around the globe.  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), United States  Industry presence in MIT AeroAstro\u2019s Space Systems class, which trains the next generation of space engineers. Integration of MIT flight operations applications into OS. Ongoing collaboration with STAR Lab missions.   University of Toronto, Canada  Project to revive HERON MkII on-orbit. Collaboration on software stacks for HERON and FINCH missions.   National University of Singapore, Singapore  Project to revive Galassia-2 on-orbit. Operations and teaching software for STAR Centre missions and classes.   Aarhus University, Denmark  Project to revive DISCO-1 on-orbit. Collaboration on operations software integrations for DISCO-2 and 3 missions.    We have a line of university space programs around the world waiting to talk to us, but had to pause for fundraising in San Francisco. Just a handful of academic space programs function as the source of almost all engineering talent in the space industry. These collaborations are invaluable for our journey towards product-market fit, and provide a platform to gain flight heritage for Basalt. About Us In 2020, Alex hired a 17-year old Max to fix broken satellite radios in the back shed of a Los Angeles dentistry. Over the next few months, the duo would assemble a crack team of engineers in LA and Cambridge to bring MIT\u2019s CubeSat program back to life. Six months later, the completed satellite was being integrated into the rocket for launch. We have been close friends ever since, and have worked in research, commercial, and government space.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Basalt Tech's Dispatch OS presents a significant technological challenge for the Latin American market. While the need for efficient satellite fleet management is global, the target market in Latin America is smaller than in developed nations with established space programs.  The high technical expertise needed to adopt and utilize Dispatch limits initial market penetration.  Cultural nuances are less significant, as the product focuses on technical specifications; however, language adaptation (Spanish and Portuguese) and potential partnerships with local universities and research institutions are essential. Economic factors play a major role; many Latin American countries have limited budgets for space technology, making the initial sales cycle lengthy and challenging.  Focus should be on demonstrating cost savings and efficiency gains over manual processes, especially for governmental agencies and emerging space programs.",

        "mvp": "The MVP should focus on a simplified version of Dispatch tailored for a specific, smaller-scale use case within Latin America. This could involve collaborating with a Latin American university with an existing CubeSat program to integrate Dispatch and demonstrate its capabilities on their hardware.  This would minimize technical integration challenges initially, generate valuable case studies, and build trust.  The MVP could then be iteratively expanded to encompass more satellite functionalities based on feedback and engagement with the university partners. The key is to achieve a working demonstration that showcases the value proposition to potential customers with smaller initial resource commitment."

We\u2019re Oscar and Akshay, and we\u2019ve built software for hardware and compliance at Twitter, Tesla, Amazon, and Hyperloop. We\u2019re making it really easy to get UL, CE, ISO, and T\u00dcV certifications like ISO 10218 and ISO 26262 for hardware products.  What are safety certifications, and who needs them? Building industrial machinery that can hurt someone, like robot arms and autonomous trucks?\u00a0 Your customers will mandate T\u00dcV safety certification per particular ISO and IEC standards! Building small appliances that plug into the grid?\u00a0 Many retailers won\u2019t sell your product, and commercial buildings won\u2019t install it unless you\u2019re UL or CE certified! Building a satellite or communication system?\u00a0 The FCC won\u2019t allow it to operate without certification! Building defense equipment for the government?\u00a0 They won\u2019t buy it unless it\u2019s compliant with the relevant MIL-STDs! Why did we start Saphira? Hardware products can\u2019t get to market because teams don\u2019t know how to navigate the certification process. Unlike SaaS, there are no tools like Vanta that tell you exactly what you need to test, change, and re-evaluate in your designs to pass audits. This sucks because every hardware company we talk to gets stuck in rework cycles with their consultants and auditors that they call \u201chorrendous and intimidating\u201d (real customer quote). We've seen this at Amazon and Tesla, where engineers don't know when a change breaks certification. Each iteration requires them to work with consultants to understand what broke, lengthening the time to launch. We created Saphira to empower these innovators to rapidly build complex products that actually work, all while achieving and maintaining compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape. What does Saphira do? Saphira tells you exactly what you need to account for in your design and testing to achieve and maintain hardware safety certification and compliance. We\u2019re a centralized data source for the requirements, tests, and standards that are relevant to your product, making it straightforward to identify and triage safety and compliance risks without wasting months of time and thousands of dollars on slow safety consultants. Saphira automates traceability: regulatory reports by engineers that prove that requirements like \u201cthe robot arm won\u2019t shock an attendant if touched while in motion\u201d were implemented and validated. These reports are painful and tedious to produce. By maintaining references to all necessary source information, Saphira can automatically generate these reports, and even automatically identify which additional standard clauses are relevant to each requirement or design value.  Who is Saphira for? Saphira is for engineers at hardware organizations of any scale and size:  The safety engineering team at an industrial robotics company can use Saphira\u2019s compliance report generator (i.e. ISO-12100 and ISO-10218) to achieve certification to operate in the US. An engineering leader at a hardware startup that needs UL certs to sell to more customers can use Saphira to speed up their process by months by avoiding hiring a slow safety consultant. A systems engineer at an aerospace/defense company can use Saphira\u2019s AI tooling to understand how various military and government standards (such as MIL-STD-810 or ISO-26262) are relevant to each facet of their specs and models.

Our scientific hypothesis engine iterates upon breakthrough chemistry from the laboratory to achieve clarity and control over the molecular basis of disease. We focus on the intersection of neuroinflammation and immunology, where uncommon molecular insights position us to develop best-in-class therapies for millions of patients in need. Our thesis: A hypothesis engine to scale and commercialize scientific creativity Our ability to measure and manipulate biology has grown beyond the wildest expectations. Yet, thousands of diseases remain with inadequate treatments. The global biotechnology industry now faces a human bottleneck where the ability to formulate hypotheses and design rigorous experiments is far outpaced by the deluge of accessible data.  A new wave of powerful tools spanning both wet lab and computation has emerged for answering scientific questions. From our perspective, the greatest challenge and impact lies first in asking the right questions rather than simply accelerating the answers. The eventual success of a pharmaceutical drug in the clinic hinges upon crucial insights formed years in advance, and there is little ability to backtrack if better routes are identified. Our autonomous hypothesis engine represents a revolutionary turning point where AI that can reason and rapidly formulate, test, and refine valuable ideas will work alongside interdisciplinary scientific teams. Rather than looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack, our approach begins with the patients and centers on identifying the best possible mechanism to reverse disease with minimal side effects. We are excited about the broader industry applications of this new approach to scientific research and general-purpose AI. At the same time, we understand the real-world complexities of bringing medicines to the clinic and remain laser-focused on conducting our technology R&D in lockstep with efficient progression of our therapeutic programs. Our science: reconciling the physical world of atoms with cellular behavior We are focused on a narrow set of phenomena that are ubiquitous across drug targets yet pivotal for our autoimmune and inflammatory disease programs. Our technology translates the dynamic physical world of atoms into a chemical code that we apply in our laboratory to change cellular behavior. Reconciling biophysics with pathway biology is a holy grail of drug discovery and we are dramatically pushing this frontier. For instance, we are able to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in measuring molecular interactions in living cells by a factor of 1000x. This challenging feat rewards us with unprecedented clarity into the molecular basis of disease and how to reverse it. We select our targets based on where our laboratory provides an ideal data source for our AI and where validated biology meets enormous unmet patient needs and market opportunities. Our Team We are a small, creative team with the highest scientific standards. Our founder, Brian Petkov, is a theoretical physicist and drug hunter with degrees in mathematics and chemistry from Duke University and doctoral training from NYU. He was previously the first employee and Vice President at a computational drug design startup, where he led the Machine Learning operation and grew a 30-person team to success on previously undruggable targets.  After years in the biotechnology industry, he realized that the major bottlenecks in early drug discovery could be solved using a combination of AI and wet-lab molecular biology techniques that very recently emerged. He started Junction Bioscience to tackle the biggest challenges and markets and ultimately bring meaningful cures to patients in need. Traction We received our first six-figure partnership within a week of incorporating, and our early academic case study kindled a successful research collaboration with big pharma.  The Ask We welcome collaboration proposals around our drug discovery platform. We are focused on our internal therapeutics pipeline and are open to partnership discussions across the biotech and pharma ecosystems. Contact brian@junction.bio. ",

We did undergrad together in Zurich, Switzerland before moving to the US to do our grad studies and research on AI at MIT, publishing several peer-reviewed papers on LLMs. One night on campus when the three of us were brainstorming startup ideas together, we agreed that in order to increase our chances of success and stay mentally sharp, we should all attend weekly therapy sessions. Not being patient enough to wait until we\u2019d receive funding and could afford it, we built the very first version of Sonia over the weekend. We then quickly realized that it was not just the 3 of us who needed an affordable therapy solution and we haven\u2019t looked back since. 70 Million Americans are Suffering More than 20% of the population struggles with their mental health each year. However, with long waitlists and high bills, therapy is inaccessible for most. Our goal is to make mental health care available anytime, anywhere and for anyone.

It empowers Flutter developers with the tools and capabilities they need to become full-stack developers. We are introducing \"Cloud Widgets\", a set of primitives which enable you to declaratively define every piece of your backend and infrastructure in Dart.  As the role of the front-end developer evolves towards full-stack proficiency, we recognize that existing tools have fallen short for those specializing in Flutter. Using the programming language and patterns Flutter developers already know from building their frontend, Celest enables developers to build and connect their apps to their backend with no additional tooling.  We enable Flutter developers to concentrate on building features and delivering value to their customers rather than learning additional domains and fragmenting themselves across disparate toolchains.CelestFounded:2023Team Size:1Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Dalton Caldwell\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Former FoundersDillon NysFounder & CEO at Celest. Previously, I wrote the Amplify Flutter framework at AWS.Dillon NysCelest\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesCelest \ud83d\udc99 turning every Flutter developer into a full-stack developerWhen I was at AWS building Amplify Flutter, I found myself wanting to write more and more of my code in Dart. I loved being able to maintain my flow state and use a single programming language\u2014one I\u2019d grown quite fond of\u2014for everything. CLIs, tooling scripts, HTTP servers\u2026 if I needed a piece of code, I would find a way to write it in Dart. The ecosystem for these use cases was immature but that just made it a challenge, which I loved. Use the right tool for the job, you may say. Nah\u2026 I want to use Dart. I thought I was alone in this quest but, I was okay being the crazy one. And then, to my surprise, our customers began asking \u201cWhen can I write my Lambdas in Dart?\u201d \u201cWhen is AWS going to release an SDK for Dart so I can use it in my backends?\u201d It dawned on me that there was perhaps something deeper we were all experiencing, something more fundamental about coding being expressed. JavaScript is one of the most popular server-side languages in use today. A reasonable person with no knowledge of JavaScript may conclude from this that it\u2019s because JavaScript is performant, efficient, or otherwise designed for the server. The reality, though, is that developers will often seek the path of least resistance in an environment replete with friction. It\u2019s easy to deride a choice in language, but it\u2019s hard to downplay the numbers. Software engineers are human, after all\u2014and humans are constantly optimizing their flows. Flutter was born from a desire to solve this age-old quest of optimization\u2014first, as a way to build iOS and Android apps from the same codebase, saving teams the burden of managing two separate products. Then, to desktop and web applications, dramatically reducing the barrier to entry for these platforms too. The vision is largely realized. And, thanks to Dart, it\u2019s been done without sacrificing performance.  Our mission with Celest is to fill in the last piece of this puzzle\u2014the cloud. We do that, simply, by starting and ending with Dart. Here\u2019s how you define a cloud function with Celest.  And here\u2019s how you add authentication.  To test it out, you run celest start and iterate on your backend locally as you build your Flutter app. Your functions hot reload as you save your changes, and integration comes free with an auto-generated client library.  And when you\u2019re ready to turn this into a fully managed and auto-scaled backend, you run celest deploy. That\u2019s it.  As a Flutter developer, I\u2019ve never left the Dart programming language, never thought about the many layers of abstraction beneath, and didn\u2019t even need to leave my IDE to solve an otherwise laborious and flow-breaking task. I\u2019m back to writing my app in less than 5 minutes. It feels like I\u2019d never left.  Celest is the product I always wanted as a Flutter developer, the tool I had felt crazy for wanting at one point. It feels a little less crazy now, but only time will tell :-) You can try and play with Celest for free today. Our cloud offering has started rolling out to the waitlist and will be publicly available in the coming weeks.

(i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)Dillon has been a member of the Flutter community since 2018 and worked at AWS on the Amplify Flutter product for two and a half years. At AWS, he created the first comprehensive Dart SDK, aimed at helping Flutter developers connect their apps to AWS. This SDK received positive reception within the Flutter community. However, he identified a persistent challenge: Flutter developers were still facing difficulties in crafting their backends, since it required them to spread themselves across different toolchains and programming languages. Recognizing this gap, Dillon left AWS with the idea of creating a dedicated platform for Flutter developers to unlock their ability to build every part of their apps in Dart. He submitted an application to Y Combinator only an hour before the deadline and was accepted into the Winter 2024 batch. Now, he\u2019s able to realize the vision started at AWS: significantly improving the Flutter development landscape. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?Our vision is centered on expanding the capabilities and reach of Flutter and Dart developers. By providing a solution that facilitates backend development in Dart, we are enhancing and completing the story for the Flutter and Dart ecosystem by making Dart a comprehensive language for building full-stack applications. Dart's strong typing and sound design patterns make it an attractive alternative for those currently using JavaScript/TypeScript for web development. Ultimately, we aspire to make Flutter and Celest synonymous with app development in general, revolutionizing the way apps are built regardless of the platform or device types being targeted. Selected answers from Celest's original YC application for the W24 BatchWhat is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do. We're crafting an event-driven, extensible platform tailored to Flutter[1] developers, enabling them to build cloud-connected apps using the programming language and tooling most familiar to them. In today's world, the front-end developer role is rapidly expanding towards full-stack proficiency. But full-stack has failed Flutter developers, and their tooling is at fault. Flutter developers are demanding more integrated and holistic tooling so they can focus on what matters most--solving their users' problems. While platforms like Vercel[2] empower web developers with a fully-managed cloud offering, Flutter lacks a counterpart. Our platform fills this gap, providing a swift and intuitive experience for this under-served and growing market.

Cultural nuances are less of a concern, as the value proposition is technical. A tiered pricing strategy (freemium, perhaps) targeting individual developers and small businesses would be more suitable than a purely enterprise-focused approach, at least initially. Success hinges on clear, easily digestible documentation and support in Spanish.",

Former Lead PM at EBANX (a Brazilian payments Unicorn) and former PM at the Brazilian Space Agency.Lucas RosaSalvy\u00a0Company LaunchesSalvy - Simplifying Telco for businesses in BrazilWe're Artur, Lucas, Hudo, and Duda, the team behind Salvy. We're simplifying mobile and IT management for businesses. Our mission is to cut through the chaos of telecom and IT services in Brazil.  The Problem Companies in Brazil are tangled in complex telecom contracts and lost in inefficiencies. It's a universal headache, especially for businesses scaling up. That's where we step in. Customer Pains  Cost inefficiency. Companies use only 30% of what they purchase and around 20% of mobile lines are unused. No transparency. Companies don't know who is using it, how much they are using and for what. Companies have no autonomy to manage their lines. The mobile operators offer a very limited platform, increasing the need for customer service. Awful customer service. Incumbents provide low autonomy customer service that leaves customers with no effective help. Confusing payments. Invoices are long and confusing. Big companies have to hire consultants to understand how much they are paying. Some customers have over 120 telecom invoices a month.  Our Solution Salvy simplifies how companies purchase and manage mobile telecom, turning it into SaaS. Our platform provides a transparent, efficient way to handle mobile lines and IT demands (such as inventory management), minus the traditional hurdles. We use AI to read telecom invoices and help companies migrate to Salvy. In just over a year, we've acquired +250 companies and have a 322% NDR with a 0,2% churn. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io7iavc7qc0   Our Vision Our goal is to be the one-stop-shop solution for all things IT, much like Rippling IT Cloud. We're using telco as a gateway to provide other solutions such as inventory and SaaS management, using AI to empower these solutions with speed and efficiency. We believe in three strategies:  Retention is inherent in B2B mobile telecom when you do a good job and there are no loyalty contracts. Mobile telco works as the gateway to other IT solutions for mid-sized companies If you can work as a one-stop-shop software for IT, you can build a really successful business.

(i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)It all started when Lucas landed in S\u00e3o Paulo/Brazil for a business trip and went out of data on his mobile plan. He did not want to leave the airport with no gigs, so he decided to add new ones. But, there was no app. He then tried calling customer support. That started a 1:30 hour-long call to add a simple GB. That was the ignition for Salvy. From that day on, we focused on telco and found that it was the right space to tackle.

Cultural nuances are less of a concern, as the solution targets a business-oriented segment. However, a careful assessment of competitive landscape and potential regulatory hurdles within the Brazilian telecommunications sector is crucial.

We autocorrect faulty model output in real-time and automatically fine-tune models that learn from their mistakes. This means our customers get more reliable results immediately, and over time, they gain custom models built specifically for their application that only get better and faster. You wouldn\u2019t hire an employee who doesn\u2019t learn from their mistakes\u2014so why use a model that doesn\u2019t?

A true jack of all trades, I have hands-on experience with infrastructure, software development, the machine learning stack, and everything in between.Ian HoegenMaitai\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesMaitai - Reliable AI without the heavy liftTL;DR: Maitai is an ultra-lightweight layer between your app and LLM providers, ensuring reliability and passive continuous improvement. Try Maitai The Problem: Getting LLMs into production is complex and time-consuming. Teams today spend much of their time-fighting hallucinations, suboptimal output, and mitigating problems plaguing their providers. Though this is necessary for a production-ready application, it can be a massive distraction from building and expanding the core product, not to mention a sizable investment. Hallucinations can quickly deteriorate the user experience and are difficult or impossible to fully fix. Model outages or degraded performance make any meaningful traffic a nightmare. Consistent response times are usually only solved today with dedicated compute environments, which can be too costly for most companies to consider. The more you make progress on these issues, the more you become locked into a provider. The Solution: A Dependable Middleman Maitai integrates seamlessly between the application and model providers to handle the heavy lifting behind the scenes. The result? Higher quality, reliable model output with passive incremental improvement - without any new code. We leverage our robust real-time evaluation engine to build a deep understanding of the customer's application, as well as the capabilities of all major models, in order to deliver consistent, dependable results. This abstraction layer is essential as the AI landscape evolves and new models emerge.  Real-time Evaluations For each application, we build an understanding of the expectations that the user has for each request. We then evaluate all model output to ensure it adheres to these expectations, in under 200ms. Detected faults can be surfaced to the user in a callback or webhook. Users can also allow Maitai to leverage these evals to autocorrect any faulty output we find, ensuring clean, reliable responses. Example: One of our customers is a voice-ordering company for restaurants. They use Maitai to ensure the model always requests consent from the customer before sending a text message. Failure to do so would put them out of compliance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, resulting in heavy fines and lawsuits. Maitai has prevented this from happening 14 times.  Highly-available Inference As AI adoption grows, all providers are having trouble keeping up with the demand. As we continuously profile all models we support, we see this manifest as outages and degraded performance many times throughout each day. Maitai uses our model health data to preemptively fall back to a similar model if we notice degraded performance or an outage. Avoid failed responses and get more consistent response times without shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars on dedicated compute.  Our health checks on gpt-4o from us-west2 show consistent performance only ~90% of the time, with frequent spikes to 400%+ usual response times. Passive Incremental Improvement With Maitai, you gain access to models that are higher quality than GPT-4o, 5x faster, and 10x cheaper \u2014 tailored specifically for your application. Our evaluation data not only allows us to immediately improve output quality and reliability, but also lends way to passively building application-specific models that are higher quality, more performant, and cost less than closed-source alternatives. Access the best models for your application, with updates as often as every few days. Actionable Alerts Get briefed on problems as they occur to quickly remedy a bad situation. Maitai surfaces real-time faults or session summaries right in Slack, then allows you to chat with your data to explore deeper.

A pre-configured dashboard rarely solves the problem since the needs of the account are constantly evolving & every user in the account tracks different metrics. These ad-hoc requests come to the customer success manager, who takes it to an analyst or engineer who fetches data, reconfigures the dashboard, and generates a report which takes 48-72h on average depending on complexity of the query.

At a young age, Melvin fell in love with computers and ended up getting his first job as a software engineer at an European unicorn at the age of 14.  While in high school, Melvin built and sold software integrations for $150K. After graduation, he served as the Head of Tech at a Stockholm-based e-commerce startup for 2 years, and studied at the top finance school in Northern Europe (SSE) before ultimately dropping out 3 months in to start Reworks.Melvin Hagbergreworks\u00a0Company Launchesreworks - the fastest way to integrate with external softwareHey everyone! We\u2019re Melvin and Erik from reworks. TL;DR: reworks is the fastest way for agentic AI companies to build integrations with external software. Instead of spending weeks integrating with traditional APIs or writing custom scraping scripts, teams use reworks to build browser-based integrations that don't require any maintenance. For example, we help customers in:  \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\u2695\ufe0f healthcare integrate with legacy EHR and PMS systems. \ud83d\udcb0 finance to perform actions or scrape data from legacy ERPs, bookkeeping software, and e-commerce platforms. \ud83d\udce6 order management to integrate with ERPs, WMS, and CRMs. \u2696\ufe0f legal integrate with DMS and CLM systems. \ud83e\udd1d HR & Payroll build connections with HRIS, ATS, and payroll software. \u2026 and much more!  \u274c The Problem  Teams building agentic AI today spend up to half of their time on integrations with external software. For example, a team building AI scheduling software for healthcare might have to integrate with 10s or even 100s of EHR systems - wasted time that could instead be spent on improving the core product. Additionally, many legacy systems lack official APIs, leading to developers building custom, browser-based integrations. Writing the scraping scripts is time-consuming and often results in highly unreliable and heavy maintenance. Underlying UI changes, such as an innocent popup, can completely break integrations. \ud83c\udfc6 The Solution With reworks, teams can record workflows in any browser-based software and turn them into reliable API endpoints in minutes. Integrations are built by simply recording yourself navigating the software UI and explaining in natural language what the return JSON data should look like. With reworks, you get:  Days or weeks are saved per integration using our AI-powered workflow recorder. Worry-free maintenance - If workflows break due to changes in the underlying UI, we use AI and computer vision to repair them, keeping your endpoints reliable at all times. Fully managed authentication for your end users, including storing their passwords and securely using them to log in to software on their behalf.  To illustrate, here\u2019s a demo of Melvin building an integration to Amazon in <6 minutes: https://www.tella.tv/video/reworks-demo-1-gufr   \ud83e\uddda Why we started working on this reworks started off as an AI assistant for e-commerce customer support. It was all smooth sailing until we started to onboard customers and realized that for each new customer we wanted to onboard, there were several systems that we had to integrate our AI agent with (e.g., ERPs, WMS, and CRMs), each taking weeks to build via traditional APIs. We spoke to over 40 other YC companies building in agentic AI and realized that external integrations are fundamental for the new wave of AI companies, but building them is way more painful than it should be. We\u2019re on a mission to change that. \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea The Team  We\u2019re two passionate AI builders originally from Sweden.

Unlike any existing engine, it\u2019s efficient at every speed. Because it\u2019s efficient at every speed, it enables us to build a new jet aircraft with unique capabilities. It can launch payloads to orbit for 3x cheaper or fly 3x faster than regular passenger aircraft.Latest NewsIan Brooke wants to revolutionize flight as we know itSep 27, 2024Ian Brooke wants to revolutionize flight as we know itSep 27, 2024Astro Mechanica - Not Boring by Packy McCormickApr 01, 2024Astro MechanicaFounded:2021Team Size:8Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Harj Taggar\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersIan Brooke, FounderVelocity enthusiast.Ian BrookeAstro Mechanica\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesAstro Mechanica: New jet engines for the new Jet AgeAstro Mechanica: New jet engines for the new Jet Age Accelerating access toward space and across the planet, enabled by the world\u2019s first electric adaptive jet engine. TL;DR Astro Mechanica has invented a new kind of jet engine \u2013 the Electric Adaptive Engine. Unlike any existing engine, it's efficient at every speed. Because it's efficient at every speed, it can be used in new and different ways. It can launch payloads to orbit 3x cheaper than an all rocket system, or enable a passenger aircraft 3x faster than an airliner. Jet Aircraft Stopped Improving in the 1970s Jet aircraft have powered much of the global economy through trade and commerce since the advent of the Jet Age, yet the technology has not changed foundationally in over 40 years. Modern commercial jets are still using (more or less) the same airframes that were originally designed in the 1970s. The first Boeing 737 flew in April 1967 and the first Airbus A300 flew in October 1972. Jet engines \u2013 which are limited by a trade-off between speed and efficiency \u2013 have similarly only seen incremental improvements. Newer jet engine designs (like the turbofan) are more fuel-efficient, but slower than older ones (like the turbojet). The New Jet Age  Powered flight starts with the engine. To change flight, you must change the engine. Astro Mechanica has invented a new type of jet engine that is efficient at every speed. We call it the Electric Adaptive Engine and it is not only more fuel efficient than modern jet engines, but 3x faster. We\u2019ve achieved this by using electric motors to drive the compressor, allowing it to spin at variable speeds and \"adapt\" to its airspeed and combustion cycle. We built our proof-of-concept engine in just two months \u2014 something that would take the typical aerospace company a year to build. We\u2019re now finishing up our first flight engine in just three months using $500k of off-the-shelf hardware. The next step is to build an airframe over the next 6-8 months to use that engine. We\u2019ll then put it all together and demonstrate supersonic flight in 2025. Here\u2019s some photos from that first flight engine build      Astro Mechanica\u2019s Master Plan  Phase 1: De-risk technology for passenger aircraft certification through applications like space launch Phase 2: Establish manufacturing and operational capacity to offer private flights Phase 3: Scale operational capacity and make supersonic flight affordable Why Are We Starting with Launch? Because it is cheaper, easier, and a regulatory hack to supersonic passenger travel.  Less stringent FAA regulations Fastest and highest return on technical investments Quickest iteration loop with off-the-shelf hardware \u201cTactical Response\u201d capability \u201cMulti-role\u201d aircraft with commercial and military applications  What Are the Benefits of Launching at Speed? An increase in payload capacity at a lower cost. We can deliver 3.5x more payload capacity by air-launching a rocket at 800 m/s \u2013 that also makes it 3.5x cheaper than launching from the ground.

        "feasibility_analysis": "This startup, focused on revolutionary jet engine technology, presents significant challenges for the Latin American market.  The market size for supersonic passenger travel or space launch services is extremely limited in the region, given the economic realities and existing infrastructure.  While there might be niche applications for cargo transport in specific sectors, the primary target market (high-speed passenger travel or space launch) is far removed from the current priorities and economic capabilities of most Hispanic countries.  Cultural nuances aren't a direct barrier, but the high capital requirements and technical sophistication make the idea unsuitable for immediate implementation on a large scale.  Economic factors heavily weigh against this venture's feasibility; it's highly capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment and a long development timeline. It might be more suitable for developed nations first.",

        "mvp": "Given the high technical complexity and limited market, an MVP in Latin America would focus on a drastically reduced scope. Instead of full-scale jet engine development, the MVP could involve creating a highly simplified simulation model demonstrating the engine's key advantages (increased efficiency and speed). This model could be presented to potential investors or government agencies (potentially those with space programs) to secure funding for further development.  Another approach might involve seeking partnerships with established aerospace companies in more developed nations for pilot projects focusing on specific applications with a lower initial investment. This would focus on niche applications rather than mass-market adoption in Latin America."

For businesses starting from scratch, we help design agents tailored to your workflows, capable of taking on entire processes autonomously. For those with existing agents, we provide a systematic way to measure performance, identify gaps, and make improvements\u2014before customers complain or workflows break down. Watch our demo here:     Why is this important? Every company will be an AI agent company. But building agents is tough, and knowing if they\u2019re actually working well is even harder. Can your agent give accurate answers? Is it handling tasks like generating code or analyzing contracts the way you\u2019d expect? Most businesses don\u2019t have a clear way to figure this out\u2014they only realize something\u2019s wrong when customers complain or workflows start breaking. Without the right tools, it\u2019s a guessing game. Foundry takes out the guesswork, helping you build agents that work as they should and keep getting better, so you can trust them to run key parts of your business.  Our solution Foundry is a platform that helps businesses build, evaluate, and improve AI agents:  For New Agents: We help companies design modular agents tailored to their workflows, capable of automating tasks like analyzing contracts, generating code, or resolving customer queries across languages. For Existing Agents: Foundry provides tools to systematically evaluate and improve agents, measuring dimensions like accuracy, relevance, task completion rates, and code execution reliability.  Using a SOTA factuality checker, internal knowledge bases, historical data, and evaluation datasets, we identify where agents fall short.

For example, users could chat with Jon Snow bot made by George R. R. Martin.   Character chat is the most engaging social category ever - more than YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok. But all the current chatbots are fan-made knock-offs and do not have deals with the actual content owners, whose IP they are stealing.

Nina holds degrees in Computer Science and Economics from UC Berkeley.Nina HuDreamRP\u00a0Company LaunchesDreamRP: Character.ai meets PatreonWhat is DreamRP? DreamRP lets creators earn money by turning their characters into chatbots. For example, George R.R. Martin could charge fans to chat with a Jon Snow bot. TL;DR AI roleplaying is wildly popular, but no existing platform focuses on the most impactful component of the experience: the creators who make the characters. With a more ethical implementation of AI and the right creation and monetization features, DreamRP has unlocked AI roleplaying for the most talented and successful creators. What\u2019s up with AI roleplaying? AI-driven roleplaying chatbots are going through a weird phase right now\u2014grassroots demand for the experience has nearly outpaced the platforms that provide it. Offerings from companies like Character.ai and even Meta\u2019s new AI Studio emphasize practical GPT-like assistants, but leaderboards are filled with fantasy heroes, movie villains, and anime waifus. On their coattails are many scrappier alternatives (even the small ones reach hundreds of thousands in ARR), as well as an enthusiastic open-source community fine-tuning their own roleplaying models for home-brew solutions like SillyTavern. It\u2019s no surprise that 12 of the top 20 applications using OpenRouter this month and 6 of the top 20 Gen AI web products are mainly used for AI roleplaying.  What they\u2019re all missing: a creator focus Competing in such a crowded space is challenging. With open source now advancing the frontier with models like Flux.1 and Llama 3.1, once-rare levels of performance and innovative features are becoming commonplace. Pushing the boundaries of uncensored content frequently leads to an early death. User acquisition ads that were previously effective are now being priced out. All of these platforms neglect a crucial component of the roleplaying experience: the creators who make the characters. Even with the best models and features, refining the character prompt, image, and scenario to be engaging takes effort and imagination, and users frequently need to dig through junk to find a character that performs well. When the tech is commoditized, the platform with the best creators has the best content and, therefore, the best product. Untapped potential Where are the best creators? Despite fans' demand for their content, the artists, authors, and other creators who traditionally make works of fiction are nowhere to be seen on these platforms. To them, current platforms are actually taboo: so marred by ethical concerns over industry usage of AI-generated art and the scraping of training data that even being associated with AI would ostracize them from the creative community.  What users are left with are inconsistent fan-made renditions of popular characters and a lack of community around the content itself. Stigma over using roleplaying chatbots has limited the sharing and discussion of these experiences in the vibrant fandoms surrounding these creators and their works. Enter DreamRP  We are Phillip and Nina, and we built DreamRP to empower creators in the AI roleplaying landscape. With an implementation of AI that addresses the ethical concerns of the creative community, specialized creation tools, and monetization features that reward creators for their work, DreamRP removes the barrier separating creators and their fans. With our platform, creators who previously would\u2019ve been canceled for even mentioning the syllables \u201cA\u201d and \u201cI\u201d in adjacent sentences have onboarded onto our platform, created characters, and publicly promoted them to their fans on social media.

Alex is passionate about affordable housing, and after years of doing construction on the side, he merged his passions and started Drillbit. His company seeks to optimize and scale home service businesses through automating their operational & administrative workflows.Alexander SeutinDrillbit\u00a0Company LaunchesDrillbit \ud83e\uddf0 Handling office work for residential contractors~TLDR~ Residential contractors are drowning in office work that has nothing to do with their core business. Drillbit automates all of it. We use AI receptionists and an LLM based quoting tool on top of our own CRM to entirely manage jobs from lead, to quote, to scheduling, to staffing, and finally payment.  Problem\ud83d\udea8 Residential contractors provide a critical service to our economy: building and maintaining the supply of housing. Unfortunately, those businesses are still operated in an incredibly manual way. Across the U.S., we spend about $675B/year on simple home maintenance. A significant portion of that cost is attributed to the office work involved with finding, coordinating, and managing those small jobs. Business owners need to (and prefer to) remain focused on the real work instead of non-value-driving efforts. Solution \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Drillbit allows contractors to be entirely hands-off, enabling them to focus 100% of their time on their core business. We have built AI receptionists that can coordinate with businesses and homeowners at every stage in the process. The receptionists then work with our AI estimators to provide quotes. Together, they are able to use our CRM, project management, and payment solutions to store updates and take action throughout the process. Landscape \u26f0\ufe0f Platforms that have come before us were able to move service business operations from texting and emailing over to CRMs and project management solutions, but they suffer from massive churn rates. Owners we have spoken with have consistently voiced the feeling that they were \u201cbabysitting\u201d the tool. All of that \u201chomework\u201d they had to do entirely undermined the value of the solution in their eyes, and so, most users would abandon the platform. Rather than expecting our users to change their behavior - ie. start using technology that they would rather not be interacting with - we have met them where they are by handling the job coordination in a way that feels familiar to them: offering the ability to talk to your \u201cemployees\u201d on the phone like you would a real person, and having those \u201cemployees\u201d be able to engage with homeowners over the phone like real people would too. Team \ud83d\udc77\ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Alex\u00a0(Stanford CS / AI) and\u00a0Liam\u00a0(WashU CS) first worked together developing robots for industrial construction projects. Alex would go on to spend a few years renovating airstreams and building a house for his family. During that time, Alex became intimately familiar with the pain points in the construction and home service industries and realized how much of a need there was for better, more automated software. At that point, Alex called Liam, and together, they started building Drillbit to support the folks maintaining America's housing.  Ask \ud83d\ude4f The platform has been built, and now we are looking to drive revenue.

(i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)Alex and Liam first worked together developing robots for industrial construction projects. Alex would go on to spend a few years renovating airstreams and building a house for his family. During that time, Alex became intimately familiar with the pain points in the construction and home service industries, and realized how much of a need there was for better, more automated software. At that point, Alex called Liam and together they started building Drillbit to support the folks maintaining America's housing. What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?Across the United States, we spend $700B/year on maintaining homes. Half the cost of any given home service is attributed to compensating the work it took just to coordinate that job. We believe that can and should be solved for. Owners need to (and prefer to) remain focused on \u201cthe real work\u201d instead of non-value driving efforts. Businesses in this industry provide an essential service to our economy - they maintain our supply of housing - but they are operated in an incredibly manual and wasteful way. We solve that with AI receptionists that can coordinate with each of the parties at every stage in the process. The receptionists can then work with our AI estimators to provide quotes, and together they can use our CRM, project management, and payment solutions to store updates and take action throughout the process. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?There are many elements that contribute to the inflated cost of housing and they impact everyone from the homeless, to renters, to homeowners, and investors. An often-overlooked contributor to this cost is the high opEx in owning and maintaining a home. The most wasteful element of that expenditure is not materials or labor - it is compensating businesses for their administrative work (finding, quoting, managing, and coordinating jobs). My dream is to cut out those inefficiencies by bringing true automation to the home service industry. In doing so, we as a society can take a step towards better, more accessible housing. Selected answers from Drillbit's original YC application for the S24 BatchDescribe what your company does in 50 characters or less.AI powered ERP for Home Service Businesses How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.Alex: Full-time for 8 months. Liam: Full-time for 2 months. What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.Home service businesses spend half their day finding work and doing administrative tasks. Jobber & ServiceTitan helped by moving businesses from paper to digital, but those platforms still require a huge amount of manual input and babysitting. AI has unlocked the next wave of automation. We already have an instant quoting system that is solving a huge pain point for SMBs: getting work. It does this by expediting the process from lead to quote. Our platform will eventually cut out all of the manual processes involved in operating any service-based business, enabling its personnel to cut out the busywork, \"get back to building\", and double their revenue.

Vespper is an on-call engineer running 24/7 to troubleshoot your alerts and surface the right data to help you resolve your issue so incidents never falls through the cracks. Whether your company is going through growing pains, needs a better handle at dealing with SEV0 or has too many low priority unsolved issues - Vespper will adapt to your needs to democratize expert knowledge across your organization. \u274c The problem Most companies drown in alerts and there are too many alerts to handle.  Engineers hate waking up at 3am to go investigate an issue, one person is familiar with one specific thing and they aren\u2019t around, there is a constant need to check for false positives. Product managers are left playing hot potato when trying to figure out the impact of incidents and bugs but engineers are too busy triaging the issue itself. Customer support are left asking \u201cwho owns\u201d which service when triaging tickets. Engineering leaders need to constantly ensure engineers are escalating quickly, they rely on service specialists to debug an issue other engineers aren\u2019t familiar with but they aren\u2019t always around during critical times.  \ud83d\udcb0 The solution Vespper is a multi-agent system that triages alerts, troubleshoots them and sends findings in seconds to Slack. It\u2019s connected to internal tools (observability, incident management, knowledge management, codebases and more) and can surface problems & identify patterns in the oceans of data you have. At the moment, we support popular tools such as:  Observability - DataDog, Grafana, Prometheus, Jaeger, SigNoz, Coralogix Incident management - PagerDuty, Opsgenie Codebases - Github Knowledge management - Notion, Confluence, Jira Communication -\u00a0 Slack, Teams (TBD)  \u2692\ufe0f How does it work?

Connect the tools you work with when triaging/troubleshooting. This means observability, knowledge, incident management and communication tools.  Once the integrations are connected, we automatically trigger advanced data ingestion pipelines that starts scraping data from your environment. This is used to train the bot. You can see the status of the ingestion & training in our web UI. Once the system is ready, it will start triaging alerts for you, post an hypothesis on Slack and show you all the automatic checks it made! \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc66 About the team  Hi, we are Topaz & Dudu \ud83d\ude0a We co-founded Vespper with the mission of making on-call stress-free.

TL;DR ShowAndTell creates AI agents for dental patient operations. Our agents educate patients, boost case acceptance, and build lasting trust. We enable dental staff to focus on patient care rather than patient operations. Our ask We\u2019d love introductions to your dentist, orthodontist, or decision-makers at DSOs and multi-practice groups. Our demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YC0PhBzYDw   Problem Dentistry is a $150B industry where providers ask patients to pay thousands to solve problems they often can\u2019t even see. The average treatment plan is over $4k for diagnoses patients simply don\u2019t understand. This lack of understanding breeds confusion and skepticism, causing patients to decline necessary care. Compounding the problem, dental staff are stretched thin. They must balance treatment planning, case presentations, financing, insurance coordination, appointment scheduling, and patient inquiries\u2014both during and outside live visits. Hiring, retaining, and training this critical staff is getting harder, with over half of US practices struggling post-COVID, according to the ADA. When patients don\u2019t trust or understand their treatment, they leave without accepting necessary care. This jeopardizes their health and leaves practices missing out on 70% of their revenue potential. Patients need better education and more personalized attention from staff. Solution Our agents help patient coordinators educate, retain, and convert patients from the moment they step into the clinic. After their visit, ShowAndTell creates personalized & interactive treatment plans that explain the what, why, and how behind their procedures. Treatment coordinators use these plans for live case presentations, and patients refer to them when they leave the practice. Patients can chat with their plan, ask the doctor questions, and book follow-up visits.  Once a patient has left, ShowAndTell agents create personalized messages to check-in with patients and get them in for re-care.  Team Danny & Justin met on the second day of college at Penn. Since then, they\u2019ve lived, traveled, and done their best work together. They built some of the first LLM customer support agents when there was only GPT playground, and have both built products at consumer and healthcare AI startups. Danny is a top 25 App Store developer, has built and launched a ProductHunt product of the week, and helped scale Ramp Bill Pay to $xxxm of payment volume.

CTGT helps enterprises eliminate hallucinations and unwanted behavior in LLMs while dramatically accelerating time-to-production. Utilizing CTGT's Platform for Model Evaluation and Monitoring \ud83d\ude80 - Watch Video   The Problem: \u201cBlack Box\u201d of AI The status quo of deep learning involves throwing more compute at models with the expectation that they will achieve true intelligence. The questionable nature of this assumption aside, this will certainly lead to more complex models that we don\u2019t meaningfully understand. I\u2019ve been obsessed with AI and its potential to change the world since I was a kid. In high school, I took apart old laptops to eke out just a bit more performance to train models, so I\u2019m exceedingly aware how important access to and understanding AI is. (For more background, check out the great piece TechCrunch did on us.) Enterprise companies are sitting on powerful AI models but can't deploy them due to hallucinations and unpredictable behavior.  Healthcare providers can't risk medical chatbots giving dangerous advice Financial firms need guarantees their AI won't recommend fraudulent investments Tech companies need AI that consistently aligns with their brand voice  Our Solution: Principled AI Development CTGT takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than black-box approximations, we've developed breakthrough technology that understands how neural networks actually learn. This allows us to:  Automatically detect and eliminate hallucinations Train models 10x faster with 10x less compute Give enterprises foundational control over AI behavior  How it works: Let\u2019s imagine we ask an LLM about cooking food. I started lunch by simmering water on the stove. I prepared dough for a homemade pizza dish. Using a knife, I sliced fresh tomatoes and cheese. I spread glue on the bread for tomorrow's breakfast. The dough rose in the oven. I brewed tea while stirring the soup with a spoon. A plate was set, and lunch was nearly complete. Every pot and utensil had its place. We can determine, for example, that pizza and bread is part of the \u201cfood\u201d concept in the model, along with other related things in the output. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSDro9tEz_w\u00a0   And we can determine that \u201cglue\u201d shouldn\u2019t be part of this concept. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skW5Z5CPr9o\u00a0   Our technology ensures \u201cglue\u201d doesn\u2019t appear in queries regarding food, reducing hallucinations by 80-90%. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH8x9boOtF4\u00a0   Real Results with Fortune 10 Companies We're already helping major enterprises deploy AI with confidence:  Removed bias from facial recognition systems in one step Eliminated investment advice hallucinations for portfolio managers Enabled fraud detection LLMs with precise error identification  The Team Founded by UCSD researchers pushing the boundaries of AI:  Cyril Gorlla (CEO): Recipient of the Endowed Chair's Fellowship at UCSD.

Trevor (CTO): Deep learning researcher focused on high powered distributed ML systems under Hao Zhang, a student of Databricks Founder Ion Stoica, at UCSD.  Why Now Legacy companies and those without access to massive amounts of compute can greatly benefit from specialized, domain-specific AI. Current LLM interpretability methods are extremely inefficient, effectively rendering them inaccessible to the vast majority of companies. There\u2019s a shift from large foundation models to those tailored to each company\u2019s brand and applications. Our technology enables this future by making state-of-the-art AI accessible without massive compute resources. Interested in the Next Generation of AI?

We believe that automating compliance can enable smaller financial institutions to exist in the long term.  \u274c\u00a0 The Problem: Consumer lending is very litigious and\u00a0consequently, it is heavily regulated: agencies such as CFPB, FDIC, and OCC impose a lot of intentionally ambiguous regulations. Currently, the audits are extremely manual. Even with a large team of auditors,\u00a0 they can only check a fraction of the calls\u2014sometimes as low as 2% which means that violations can be missed.\u00a0Often, there is \u201cjust enough ambiguity\u201d that the calls and communication warrant manual reviews. This is problematic because an internal audit system might not suffice for compliance purposes. \ud83e\udd14 How does it work?: Shiboleth automatically flags compliance violations in customer interactions. It does this by syncing with the companies' runbooks, using advanced LLMs and NLP to parse relevant regulations.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Taiki's API for tax document automation presents a compelling opportunity in Latin America, but with significant caveats.  The market size is considerable, given the growing fintech sector and increasing digitalization. However, the level of digitalization across all Hispanic countries varies greatly.  Cultural nuances also play a role; trust in automated systems handling sensitive financial data might be lower in some regions compared to others.  Economic factors like access to reliable internet and varied levels of digital literacy across demographics must be considered.  Successfully tailoring Taiki requires a phased approach, initially focusing on countries with higher digital penetration and adapting the solution to local tax regulations and reporting requirements in each target market. The need for multilingual support (Spanish, Portuguese, etc.) is crucial.  A key challenge will be convincing businesses, especially smaller ones, to adopt a new solution, particularly where trust in technology for such data is still growing.",

Decades of decline and entire generations shying away from manufacturing jobs have left the industry facing an expected 2.4 million jobs going unfulfilled by 2030. The obvious solution is to use robots, but 75% of all U.S. manufacturers are effectively unable to use traditional robotic automation due to their high-mix production: they produce a wide array of products in small quantities. Traditional automation is rigid and needs new fixturing and re-programming for each part, and doesn\u2019t provide ROI for high-mix manufacturers since so little of each part is produced. If America is unable to capitalize on the current manufacturing and AI boom, we lose out on $1 trillion per year in opportunity cost and the chance to strengthen our weakened industrial base. High-mix manufacturers are a crucial component for this and they urgently need adaptable automation solutions that can cheaply handle their large variety of parts. \ud83e\uddbe Our Solution: Pivot Robotics combines off-the-shelf robots and vision sensors with our pioneering AI vision control software to give industrial robots the ability to adapt. Our first product, Proteus, addresses the dangerous and unpopular task of grinding metal parts, offering zero-shot adaptation to new parts with the same precision, and efficiency. We do this by leveraging the latest advances in foundational vision models, allowing us to avoid the large data requirements that prior attempts of adding vision to industrial robots faced. We are currently engaged in a pilot to deploy 10+ Proteus systems at a large cast iron foundry that produces over 200 different parts a year. \ud83e\udd1d Who We Are:  We both met on the first day of college at Carnegie Mellon University, living 2 doors across from each other. Siddharth has worked on self-driving cars at Uber ATG, AI at Meta, and most recently was designing multi-agent algorithms for warehouse robots at Nimble Robotics. Vignesh optimized motion planning for general-purpose robots at Google X, researched LLM applications for robotics in the Atkeson Lab, and worked on manipulation at ABB. Both of us are inspired to use our robotics experience to solve real-world labor problems after watching our respective parents\u2019 careers in these industries (agriculture and manufacturing). \ud83d\udd2eThe Future: Expanding our vision technology to develop hand-eye coordination for robot arms, enabling the automation of tasks beyond grinding, like materials handling and assembly for high-mix manufacturers. \ud83d\ude4fOur Ask: We\u2019re looking for introductions to manufacturing partners eager to embrace AI-driven automation and investors who share our vision for the future of manufacturing. \u2709\ufe0f Contact Us: Reach out at founders@pivotrobotics.com and follow us on Twitter/Linkedin for updates and cool demos. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "The Pivot Robotics solution, while innovative, faces significant challenges in the Latin American market.  The high initial investment cost of robotic arms and AI software presents a major barrier to entry for many manufacturers, particularly SMEs which dominate the industrial landscape in many Hispanic countries.  Furthermore, the reliance on advanced technological infrastructure (reliable internet, power supply, etc.) may limit adoption in regions with underdeveloped infrastructure. Cultural nuances also play a role; workforce adaptation and training requirements need careful consideration. The market size for this technology is likely to be smaller compared to developed nations due to lower levels of automation in many industries. However, a niche market for specific high-value manufacturing sectors might exist, offering a more focused approach.",

Instead of targeting the broad manufacturing sector, identify a country or region with a concentration of a particular industry (e.g., automotive parts in Mexico, food processing in Argentina) that faces labor shortages and has a few larger manufacturers who can afford the initial investment. For the MVP, concentrate on adapting the Proteus software for one specific type of metal grinding task common in that chosen niche. Partner with a single, larger manufacturing company to pilot test and gather feedback. This reduces the scope significantly, allowing for quicker iteration based on real-world data and demonstrating value in a targeted market.  A strong emphasis on demonstrating ROI through cost savings analysis and productivity gains will be crucial to overcome initial resistance."

Hello, Hola, Guten Tag, \u4f60\u597d, etc., to you all! We\u2019re John and Brendan, the team creating Quetzal.  John (on the left) worked for three years at Slack on the Slack Connect team, handling new features and requests from customers around the world. He saw firsthand the pain that bad and challenging translations and internationalization had for everyone at the company, from engineers, to CSMs, to PMs, to users. Brendan (on the right) worked for two years at Mercatalyst, a retail startup founded by the creator of Woot.com, which sold to Amazon in 2010. He worked extensively on the project bringing in in-house Spanish translation, and experienced the headache that this effort caused. Together, they decided to bring outdated and broken internationalization software and approaches into the year 2024 with Quetzal. Why is the current approach to internationalization and translation broken? \ud83e\udd15 If you're just starting out going international with your product, it can be daunting to see exactly what you need to do. Translating your whole product takes time and perhaps maybe weeks or months of engineering effort, depending on what solution you go with. How do you deliver consistent and accurate translations with context about how your application works? Software translation mostly relies on engineers haphazardly providing text to an internationalization service, which then needs to translate on a string by string basis. This strategy loses important context and leads to poor quality, inconsistent translations, all while putting unnecessary work on engineers. If your company already has a robust localization system, there's a whole host of other problems. You need to juggle the constant barrage of customer confusion, growth and change to your product and messaging, and external demands to adjust wording and phrasing, sometimes at the last second. Keeping up with all of that and making your language and messaging consistent with how your product works and what your intents are is super tough and puts unnecessary stress on your localization team. Quetzal aims to tackles these problems with a new modern internationalization solution that understands your specific goals with each localization problem you're trying to solve.

Developers need expert-level knowledge of GPU programming just to build code that is not portable to new environments such as Web or Mobile or reusable across applications. Renderlet is a WebAssembly framework for writing graphics code that runs anywhere. Describe your graphics pipeline using a higher-level abstractions and use renderlet to generate low-level, cross-platform rendering code. With renderlet, developers can easily embed GPU-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics into cross-platform applications.  How it works With renderlet, we compile graphics to portable WebAssembly modules and provide a runtime that abstracts away the underlying GPU architecture to the code. Developers can take advantage of modern technologies like WebGPU without having to learn the intricacies of yet another standard. 2D and 3D graphics are fully decoupled from the application and device and can ship decoupled from the applications code in a format that runs anywhere. Renderlet is:  A compiler that takes a high-level specification of your graphics pipeline - including custom assets, functions, and libraries - and builds self-contained WebAssembly rendering modules A  renderer, wander, that embeds into any application on any platform that and safely runs rendering modules with the GPU A visual editor that makes it easy to build entire graphics and visualization pipelines out of reusable rendering modules  Anybody should be able to build interactive applications without having to be a graphics programming expert. About Us Sean Isom previously built developer platforms at Adobe as a Lead Engineer and Sr. Engineering Manager. He helped bring products to the cloud and web using tools like WebAssembly and is currently involved in standardization efforts for WebAssembly GPU support.  What\u2019s next?

Its AI-powered solution reduces the time and cost of claims processing by over 90%, enabling providers to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks. Watch our demo here.    Why is this important? In short, medical billing and coding allow healthcare providers to get paid for their services. However, the way it\u2019s currently done is still largely manual and can take several hours per patient. In 2023, the U.S. healthcare system spent $4.8 trillion, with over 35% of costs attributed to administration, much of which stems from the need to manage vast amounts of unstructured and fragmented data. This situation results in healthcare professionals spending more time on paperwork than on patient care, which reduces service capacity, delays treatment, and drives up costs.  Our solution We are starting by focusing on prior authorization, which requires the provider to get an agreement from the payer to cover specific treatments or medications. This process currently requires manually going through hundreds\u2014sometimes thousands\u2014of records to extract evidence and prove \u2018medical necessity\u2019 to the payer. By leveraging AI, we\u2019ve been able to reduce the amount of time it takes by 90%. Providers across the US invariably say this has been life-changing for them!  Moving forward Prior authorizations are just the beginning. We\u2019ve already started working with our providers to build for other aspects of the medical billing and coding process: claim denials, insurance verification, patient letters etc. We believe humans in healthcare should focus on what they do best, caring for patients, and let AI handle the rest. Our ask Medical billing and coding are relevant in all sorts of places. If you know decision-makers in any of these organisations, we\u2019d be super grateful for an introduction! Email us at\u00a0founders@taxo.ai  Hospitals Physician offices Nursing homes Outpatient facilities Billing companies Home healthcare services Durable medical goods providers Practice management companies Federal and state government agencies Commercial payers  And tell them not to worry about hallucinations. All our output is referenced and directly links back to the original patient records!  Team Ahmed Kerwan, a practicing physician, experienced firsthand the immense burden of paperwork that detracted from his ability to provide care. Determined to find a solution, he pursued a fellowship at Harvard to explore the intersection of AI and healthcare. He then partnered with Hassan Tahir, a leading deep-learning engineer specializing in state-of-the-art transformer models. Together, they created Taxo, a platform that has already enabled dozens of providers to process thousands of patient cases more quickly and cost-effectively.  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Taxo's AI-powered medical billing and coding solution faces significant challenges in the Latin American market. While the need to streamline administrative processes in healthcare is universal, several factors impact feasibility.  Market size varies greatly across Latin American countries;  developed economies like Chile and Argentina might offer a larger, more receptive market than others.  However, widespread adoption requires robust EHR infrastructure, which is inconsistent across the region.  Cultural nuances regarding data privacy and the acceptance of AI-driven solutions also need careful consideration.  Economic factors such as healthcare spending per capita and the affordability of such a solution for smaller clinics and hospitals need detailed analysis per country.  Furthermore,  language support for Spanish and Portuguese is crucial, and navigating varying regulatory landscapes related to medical billing and data protection will be essential for successful implementation.",

Before Aedilic, Lukas conducted machine learning research at the Robotic Systems Lab, a leading research institution on robot autonomy. His research has been published to ICRA, the #1 robotics conference on Google Scholar. Before that, he developed drone control algorithms at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Lukas holds a Master of Science in Robotics, Automation and Control from ETH Zurich.Lukas SchneiderAedilic\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesGPUDeploy.com \u2013\u00a0Airbnb for GPUstl;dr gpudeploy.com is Airbnb for GPUs. It is a marketplace and easy-to-integrate software for renting out the over $1bn in cheap, high-quality compute that is sitting around unused (see e.g. gpulist.ai). We are two engineers from Cambridge and ETH Z\u00fcrich with experience in Robotics and Deep Learning. \u2014 Hi, we\u2019re Nico and Lukas, the cofounders of Aedilic (doing business as GPUDeploy).  We met in high school when we were both 14 and bonded over our interest in coding. Our first project was a cookie-clicker game that we wrote during a sleepover two weeks after meeting for the first time. Nico has since received a Masters in Econometrics from the University of Cambridge with a research focus on the mathematical theory of Machine Learning algorithms (Random Forests, DBSCAN). Lukas holds a Masters from ETH Z\u00fcrich, where he trained robot dogs at the Robotics Systems Lab, using the latest Machine Learning models. During his Masters, he wrote the official ETH Z\u00fcrich RSL open-source Reinforcement Learning \u201calgorithms\u201d library. His Master's thesis was published in the highest-ranked Robotics conference (ICRA) this year. There is a lot of cheap, high-quality, unused compute sitting around gpulist.ai alone lists over $1bn in unrealized contract value. These are the latest Nvidia models in cutting-edge data centers, with Infiniband interconnect and perfect internet. They are cheap because nobody books them. Meanwhile, research labs and AI companies are looking for cheap, high-quality compute but will not go through unknown, unclear websites and the associated sales process. We allow them to book pre-configured GPU instances on-demand at wholesale prices that they would normally need to negotiate. We\u2019ve built software that makes idle GPUs in data centers accessible and super simple to book and use via our website. Data-centers and AI companies with idle compute have the option to list instances on the spot market as soon as they are available, it takes 5 minutes to set up. Unlike other solutions, our software enables fractional use of GPU boxes, so 8 GPUs can be rented out to 8 different people. Other options are either expensive, booked out, or a pain to use We know how inconvenient current solutions are because we\u2019ve dealt with them, both at university and for the previous iteration of this startup (robotics-related). For example, Lukas, during his time at ETH, was given a blank check by his lab to book GPUs for his research. He spent the entire night with his supervisor going through Google Cloud to scrape together a few GPU instances; Google will only tell you that an H100 is unavailable in Region X after you configured and launched your instance. Plus, they were expensive, with an A100 SXM 40GB at $3.60/gpu/hour (compare this to $1.28 on our site). Solution: GPUDeploy GPUDeploy is a software solution and marketplace for renting GPUs. We have made our site simple, to the point, and opinionated - there are no hurdles between you and booking a GPU. We offer very competitive pricing and ensure that the compute instance you book is reliable and meets our benchmarks.  We both have a spot offering and an Airbnb-like experience for long-term bookings. We match your spot request with available compute resources that meet our standards. You can then simply connect to the machine to run your workloads. We launched with a Show HN four weeks ago, which immediately got #1 and stayed on the front page for 2 days. Try it out! Our ask:  If you need GPUs, try it out. If you have compute, try renting it out on our site. It\u2019s really simple (2 commands) and flexible, and we help with custom onboarding. For example, you can make a profit of ~$3000k a year with an RTX4090. Currently, the majority of our computing is booked out. Anyone is able to add compute, but we will sort out unreliable providers immediately. We collaborate with data centers. If you have a cloud with idle GPUs, reach out.

We\u2019re Collin and Sabeek, the co-founders of Roundabout Technologies. We have a combined 15 years of industry experience in embedded systems and computer vision, building safety-critical software that\u2019s been deployed on medical devices at Verily and in driverless vehicles at Waymo and Zoox. As avid cyclists, we\u2019ve long taken an interest in urbanism and public infrastructure, and we both have a deep desire to see cities become more pedestrian and bike-friendly. Roundabout sits at the intersection of our interests and our professional skills, a chance for us to use our hardware and AI skills to make cities more livable. The Problem Cities want traffic infrastructure that works for their residents. But existing systems fall short. Drivers waste hours at inefficiently programmed traffic lights. This floods city governments with resident complaints, and can even cause safety issues as impatient drivers race to catch yellow lights and risk causing crashes in the process. Existing light timings have to come from traffic studies that measure traffic flows for a week and use that to determine light timings for the next 5 years, a workflow that is both expensive and imprecise. While induction loops and existing camera-based systems make things somewhat better, they are still brittle and manually programmed, so they scale poorly on complex, highly congested areas. These detection systems have limited range, unable to see cars before they\u2019ve already come to a stop at an empty red light. Pedestrians and bikes are rarely detected in these systems, so cities must add extra buttons as an afterthought to respond to pedestrian traffic. And providing priority for emergency vehicles and buses requires extra transponders be installed. Add all this up, and you get a system that requires lots of expensive hardware and manual programming but still leaves drivers, pedestrians, and transit riders deeply unsatisfied. Clearly we should be able to do better than this. And now, we can! Solution Roundabout Technologies is an AI-powered traffic control system that makes intersections safer, more efficient, and cheaper for cities to maintain. We use computer vision and commodity traffic cameras to build a 3D map of everything happening at the intersection in real time. We then use this map to simulate all possible signal states and pick the one that leads to the lowest wait times. Without solution, cities can  Greatly reduce traffic congestion Eliminate the frustration of waiting at empty intersections Respond to pedestrians and cyclists Give priority to buses and emergency vehicles And reduce resident complaints about their intersections  All in a single system, and all without ever requiring specialized hardware or bespoke traffic studies! Ask Know anyone working in municipal public works, transportation departments, or traffic engineering consulting firms? We\u2019d love to meet them! founders@roundabout.tech Team Collin Barnwell is a software leader and engineer with extensive experience building and shipping safety-critical IoT and camera devices, including a device that has been implanted in humans.

YC Sign PhotoHear from the foundersWhat is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?Almost everyone we\u2019ve talked to can tell that most traffic signals are sub-optimally timed. They\u2019ve waited at a light when nobody is going the other direction, or not gotten detected on a bike, or seen inefficient fixed-timing signals in the most congested downtown areas. Public works departments get resident complaints about these things all the time. The problem is that current detection systems can only detect the presence or absence of vehicles in fixed zones; they can\u2019t model and anticipate the actions of road users as they approach and move through the intersection. By modelling everything in 3D and simulating all possible light changes, we can pick the best action at every moment. We\u2019ve long shared an interest in infrastructure and urbanism and want to see cities become more bike and pedestrian friendly. This desire led us to traffic lights, a clear example of infrastructure that treats pedestrians and cyclists as afterthoughts. We also feel that our skillsets are very well-suited to this domain: Collin has built safety-critical IoT medical device software, and Sabeek\u2019s computer vision systems have been deployed in fully driverless vehicles on public roads. We\u2019re excited to be bringing this level of technology to municipal governments. ",

Tae and Julia were previously engineering and product leaders at Tesla, Apple, and Brex. We are trusted by award-winning solar and battery developers with nearly 1 GW of projects across the US. If you are a utility or community-scale developer, book a call with us to learn more.  \ud83d\udd0c\u00a0The Problem We are in the midst of a generational energy transition, with solar deployment expanding at an annualized rate of roughly $500B globally, and the Inflation Reduction Act unleashing another $400B in federal funding. To meet the soaring demand for clean energy, the US must build an equivalent amount of clean generation by 2035 to the total electricity supplied by all sources today. Despite this rapid deployment, utility-scale clean energy developers often spend months assessing and preparing their projects for financing and construction due to varying policies, interconnection, and permitting requirements across jurisdictions. This pre-construction phase is an error-prone and manual effort of researching and aggregating data across thousands of PDFs, websites, and maps. Many developers find themselves poring over 1000-page documents, engaging expensive consultants, or focusing on a limited number of jurisdictions. Through hundreds of conversations with developers, we consistently hear that navigating this \"complex patchwork of jurisdictions, where every state is a snowflake,\" is a major obstacle. \u2728\u00a0Enter Spark With Spark, developers can identify requirements, risks, and incentives by leveraging our curated dataset. They can now screen prospective projects in seconds, not weeks. For the first time, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a dramatically simplified method to extract grid interconnection and permitting requirements, zoning ordinances, economics (rates, tax credits, RECs), and a range of unstructured information relevant to renewables development. By refining the data specifically for this industry, Spark introduces a new way for developers to navigate through otherwise disparate and cumbersome information.  These insights are then precisely mapped to individual counties and parcels of land, accelerating the development process significantly. However, Spark\u2019s capabilities extend beyond location diligence and requirement aggregation. Our goal is to re-imagine the development workflow, enabling developers to drastically reduce the time dedicated to mundane tasks such as research, documentation, and portfolio management.  One of our customers, an industry veteran with nearly 20 years of experience, said \u201cI see this tool as my Jarvis.\u201d Our mission is to empower developers to prioritize human interactions and make strategic decisions about where to invest millions of dollars to electrify the nation\u2019s grid \u2014 not the manual, back office work. \ud83e\ude84\u00a0The (Dream) Team Tae built software while sitting inside the Model 3 factory at Tesla, wrote payment systems that processed millions in EV sales as a founding engineer at Lucid Motors\u2019 commerce team, and helped Gen Z find love at Tinder.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Baseline AI's proposition faces significant challenges in the Latin American market.  While the need for efficiency in clinical trials is universal, the target market (large pharmaceutical companies conducting Phase 3 trials) is relatively small in Latin America compared to North America or Europe.  The high cost of the solution might be a barrier for smaller companies or research institutions that may be more prevalent in the region. Cultural nuances in data privacy regulations and the need for local language support must be addressed. The economic context, including the availability of funding for such advanced technology, needs careful consideration. Success hinges on identifying specific niches within the region, possibly collaborating with larger international pharmaceutical companies already operating in Latin America, or focusing on a more affordable, scaled-down version of the product tailored to smaller clinical research teams.",

We provide access to these models via our API.Guide LabsFounded:2023Team Size:5Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Nicolas Dessaigne\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersJulius Adebayo, FounderI am a machine learning researcher working on interpretable AI systems.Julius AdebayoGuide Labs\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesGuide Labs: Interpretable foundation modelsAt Guide Labs, we build interpretable foundation models that can reliably explain their reasoning and are easy to align. The Problem: foundation models are black-boxes and difficult to align Current transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and diffusion generative models are largely inscrutable and do not provide reliable explanations for their output. In medicine, lending, and drug discovery, it is not enough to only provide an answer; domain experts would also like to know why the model arrived at its output.  Current foundation models don\u2019t explain their outputs. Would you trust a black-box model to propose medications for your illness or decide whether you should get a job interview? You can't debug a system you don't understand: When you call a model API and the response is incorrect, what do you do? Change the prompt? What part of your prompt should you change? Switch to a new model API? Difficult to reliably align or control model outputs: Even when you've identified the cause of the problem. How do you control the model so that it no longer makes the mistake you identified?  Our Solution We\u2019ve developed interpretable foundation models that can explain their reasoning, and are easy to align.  These models:  provide human-understandable explanations; indicate what part of the prompt is important; and, specify which tokens led to the model's output.  Using all these explanations, we can:  identify the part of the prompt that causes the model to err; isolate the samples that cause those errors; and, use explanations to control and align the model to fix its errors.  About Us We are a team of machine learning researchers with PhDs from MIT who have worked on interpretable models for the past 6 years. We have published more than 10 papers at top machine learning conferences on the topic. We recently developed an interpretable diffusion and large language models that can explain their outputs using human understandable concepts. We have previously built and trained interpretable models at Google and Meta. Our Ask We are interested in working with companies across lending/finance, healthcare/medicine, insurance, and drug discovery who are looking for alternative models that can reliably explain their outputs.

We are live with 400 customers and an ARR of $1.4 million.  The problem: Energy installers are eager to expand their deployment of heat pump and photovoltaic systems, yet they are constrained by inefficient sales, planning, and installation processes.  The solution: Our B2B software integrates CRM, planning, and design tools into a unified platform. This enables SMB installers to drastically cut down the pre-installation phase of home energy projects\u2014from several weeks to just minutes. By leveraging LiDAR for spatial analysis, computer vision for automated assessment, and AI for system recommendations, we streamline the entire workflow. This results in a time reduction of up to 90%, enabling installers to confidently transition to and scale up sustainable home energy solutions.Jobs at autarcView all jobs \u2192Sales Manager:inBerlin, BE, DE\u20ac70K - \u20ac100K EUR1+ yearsApply NowSenior Fullstack Engineer (React, Supabase)Berlin, BE, DE\u20ac70K - \u20ac120K EUR6+ yearsApply NowautarcFounded:2023Team Size:15Location:Berlin, GermanyGroup Partner:Nicolas Dessaigne\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersEtienne-Noel Krause, FounderEtienne, Co-Founder & CEO of autarc.

Achieving a CO2-neutral life starts with a heat pump installation\u2014it's the most efficient and sustainable alternative available. Yet, at the current installation speed, it will take over 100 years to replace the last gas or oil boiler in Europe. Etienne encountered this problem after nearly four years in the HVAC industry. Initially, we spoke with almost 80 firms to fully understand their challenges. It turns out installers would love to focus on heat pumps, but they lack the skills and tools to meet the overwhelming demand. These small, fragmented businesses across Europe struggle with scaling their processes and securing growth financing. On top of that, regulatory changes require them to manually capture hundreds of data points, leading to 60 % of installation costs being attributed to labor and process inefficiencies. \ud83d\ude0d\u00a0The Solution With autarc, we are building an operating system (OS) for heat pump installers. Our software enables installers to capture hundreds of data points in minutes rather than hours and provides them with everything they need in one place: system design, offer creation, financing options, subsidies, and mandatory reports. By leveraging LiDAR technology and AI, we reduce the overall project time for heat pump installations by 50 %.  How it works: We standardize the pre-installation process, utilizing up to 800+ data points per property. This reduces time wasted on leads that don\u2019t convert by 80% and frees up installer capacity. Our customers tell us that they save up to 20 hours per installation with our solution. \ud83c\udfe1\u00a0The Team With 15 full-time employees, we are building a European champion from our HQ in Berlin, Germany.

We're proud to be live in 10 states with over 35 dedicated therapists and are in-network with leading insurance providers, making it easier for clients to receive the support they need. The Problem Access to quality speech therapy is more challenging than ever. Many individuals, from children experiencing learning setbacks due to COVID-19 disruptions to seniors facing age-related speech issues, are struggling to get the support they need. Demand is soaring, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 21% growth in employment for SLPs from 2021 to 2031. However, the number of practicing therapists isn't growing quickly enough to meet this need, leading to long wait times and underserved communities. At the same time, many dedicated SLPs are facing burnout from overwhelming administrative tasks like insurance paperwork, scheduling, and documentation, coupled with lower pay in traditional settings. This not only affects their well-being but also worsens the shortage, as some may reduce their workload or leave the profession entirely. According to a survey by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 28% of SLPs are interested in private practice to gain more control over their work and income. There is an urgent need for a compassionate solution that supports both those seeking therapy and the professionals providing it. The Solution Verse Therapy is bridging this gap by empowering speech-language pathologists to launch and grow their own independent practices with ease.

The company funded it as a big investment in the difficult years when Twitter\u2019s growth was tanking. However, each change would take 3-6 months to pick, test, approve, and ship. We also didn\u2019t know how to use those learnings systematically to prioritize the next copy change. We started building internal tools to automate this and gained 20% additional user growth. We stumbled upon similar problems and \u201cvision docs\u201d at Pinterest. We knew we were staring at money on the table. We quit our jobs to build just words. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?The future of content is not an AI monologue. It is very much a dialogue between companies and their users. They need to meet their users where they are.Until now, there was no reason to build infrastructure to manage, rank, and compare 1000s of copy variants. Why? Because we were bottlenecked by the human effort required in writing copy. In the new AI-powered world, businesses will need infrastructure to manage, and continuously test infinite copy variations across users and products. A copy-ranking infrastructure will be table stakes for any business to survive. It will be powered by just words**. ** YC W24 Demo Day Video",

It\u2019s Saif, Omar, and Pradhit here to introduce you to Reform! \ud83e\udd13 TL;DR Reform is the easiest way for dev teams to build modern logistics software fast. Logistics service providers use our pre-built components and APIs to build software that can automate tasks such as quoting, shipment creation, and customs clearance filing. One of the largest freight forwarders in Latin America is using Reform to automate shipment creation and invoice processing.  \u274c Problem Logistics service providers rely on dated, archaic ERP and transportation management systems (TMS) to manage their operations. These systems are rigid, closed, and opinionated. Oftentimes, they require customization, and hence, the need for logistics service providers to hire development agencies to build bespoke customizations and internal tools on top of these systems to make them easier to work with. An alternative these companies resort to is to build an internal system from scratch to fit their business needs. However, such an undertaking is long, costly, and is oftentimes a distraction from their core business.  \u2692\ufe0f Solution Reform is the sweet spot between buying a generic off-the-shelf TMS and building one in-house. Our APIs and pre-built components allow logistics service providers to build the modern transportation management system they need - faster, better, and without the maintenance overhead.  Our first product is an AI-powered API suite that allows logistics service providers to build custom automations for mundane tasks related to their TMS.\u00a0  Our APIs are used to power automation use cases including: \ud83d\udea2 Shipment and quote creation \ud83d\udc6e Customs clearance filing \ud83c\udfed Warehouse order intake \ud83e\uddfe Invoice reconciliation  \u2699\ufe0f How it works Eliminate manual document analysis: Our customizable AI-powered data extraction API, purpose-built for the logistics industry, allows you to extract data with high accuracy from incoming emails and documents including commercial invoices, BOLs, packing lists, and more.   Integrate with any TMS: Our Universal API allows you to plug extracted data into any system without the burden of building and maintaining integrations.  Build beautiful interfaces: Our headless UI components allow you to embed our APIs directly in your products and customer-facing dashboards.  Meet The Team  Saif and Omar are brothers, born and raised in Jordan, before moving to the US to pursue a career in technology.

Our mission is to provide factories with a single, cohesive platform to track and manage the full lifecycle of a manufactured item across every department in their organization. https://youtu.be/kmhj7bozMro   We\u2019re already working with several factories in Indonesia, Vietnam, and India, focusing on suppliers in the automotive and electronics industries. The Problem Many factories are trapped in a web of disjointed spreadsheets and partially integrated tools, requiring costly manual data re-entry at nearly every stage\u2014unless they can afford to spend over $1M on an ERP solution like SAP. This fragmentation leads to poor visibility into true costs and inventory, resulting in over-ordering of materials and dead stock of manufactured goods. The Solution Tiny is a ground-up reimagination of cumbersome traditional ERP software. Factories now have an intuitive user experience that leverages live collaborative editing to get everyone working together seamlessly, with a workflow engine that assigns tasks to the right person at the right time. Furthermore, as we expand our platform, we plan to automate repetitive tasks, thereby reducing costs and unlocking valuable insights by unifying sales, procurement, and production processes\u2014all within a single system. Currently, we\u2019ve started at the very beginning of the order lifecycle: the quotation process. Our first module empowers sales and engineering teams to respond to customer inquiries faster and more accurately. The foundation of this module\u2014the workflow engine, the lightweight CRM, and the item library\u2014are shared in the upcoming procurement and production modules, resulting in deep integration and a seamless experience for our customers. The foundation we\u2019ve built is a fully collaborative object graph with real-time computations, plus a truly novel form input framework including automatic object syncing and interactive audit logs, on top of durable workflow execution that enables us to customize workflows extremely efficiently. Thanks to this foundation, we are uniquely positioned to unlock never-before-seen, truly interactive collaboration with AI agents.

I build software.Anish BhardwajVendra\u00a0Company LaunchesVendra - AI vendor and project management for hardware teamsTL;DR  Hardware engineers should spend their time building cool products, but they actually spend their time dealing with vendors and doing non-engineering work (digging through emails, searching for files, updating spreadsheets, etc.) Traditional project management solutions don\u2019t really work in hardware, and vendor communications inevitably revert to emails/text messages/WeChat/etc. Vendra uses AI to understand these vendor communications, giving hardware teams modern project management and instant information lookup with almost no change to their existing workflow We offer solutions to hardware teams at all stages - book a demo today!  The Team We\u2019re Shan and Anish! We\u2019ve known each other since childhood when our parents moved from India to the same apartment complex in Santa Clara. Between us, we\u2019ve built a lot of cool hardware (cameras for autonomous drones, AR/MR headsets) and cool software (ML for satellites, AI for the shipping industry).  The Problem As a former hardware engineer, Shan experienced the challenges of managing complex projects across a network of vendors, suppliers, and manufacturers. He saw hardware teams struggle to use traditional project management solutions with vendors because of the unstructured nature of projects and communications, security and access issues, and difficulties in the adoption of new processes. The workflow inevitably defaulted to emails, text messages, WeChat, etc., often leading to misplacement of crucial information. A 2021 report revealed that 70% of engineers still use email for external collaboration, struggling to track critical information across teams. 94% of engineers want faster access to data, and 29% often work with outdated information, leading to costly delays, reworks, and longer time to market. We\u2019re building Vendra to change that. The Solution Vendra uses AI to bring a smart project management suite and file repository to hardware teams working with vendors and suppliers - all with no change to existing workflows. Simply connect Vendra to your email/WeChat/WhatsApp/Slack (or cc it to your conversations and threads):  Vendra automatically contextualizes your emails/messages/files and generates key takeaways like project and conversation summaries, open items, blockers, tasks, etc. It also creates a smart file directory so you never have to go digging through emails or attachments ever again. Easily access all this information from anywhere through our SlackBot, GPT-like chat interface, or web-based dashboard:  You can ask Vendra AI things like  \u2018Show me all the quotes and lead times we got from vendors for the upper bracket machining in the past month\u2019 \u2018What are all the open items for the enclosure injection molding tooling?\u2019 \u2018Pull up the RF module datasheet the supplier sent me last week\u2019 And so much more!  For teams looking for 2-way external collaboration, we also offer VendraPM - a secure end-to-end platform to onboard your vendors and work together across projects and tasks. Features like secure file sharing, document revision control, and AI-enabled language translation make external work easier than ever:  The Ask  If you work in hardware, book a demo today!

The Solution  Today, Silurian is announcing the launch of GFT (Generative Forecasting Transformer), a 1.5B frontier model that simulates global weather up to 14 days ahead at approximately 11km resolution with unprecedented accuracy. Our model outperforms numerical weather prediction systems from the American (NOAA) and European (ECMWF) agencies by up to 30% across multiple variables. Remember Hurricane Beryl? In a simulation (shown above) run on the 1st of July, GFT correctly predicted that the hurricane would hit Texas. In contrast, the NOAA and ECMWF models wrongly predicted a landfall in Mexico, as The New York Times recently reported. GFT is immediately available to our customers via our Artificial Planetary Intelligence (API). The API allows users to easily query our models at any location on Earth, and it will become publicly available in the next few weeks.  GFT is only the beginning.

Mike, Jack's brother, joined K-Optional in 2021. There they built logistics products that were acquired or continue to generate millions in revenue, including:  A pig tracking platform that uses hardware and GPS data to check diagnostics on massive oil pipelines. A scheduling platform in the catastrophe insurance space that maps claimants to appraisal locations.  They spun Getcho out of a curbside pick-up application and went all in once they had delivered a million dollars of merchandise.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Getcho addresses a significant pain point for high-value retail in Latin America: unreliable last-mile delivery.  The market size is substantial, given the growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for reliable delivery services, especially in major urban areas. However, cultural nuances need consideration.  Trust and communication are paramount; the platform should integrate features that build trust with both merchants and delivery drivers.  Economic factors like varying levels of smartphone penetration and internet access across different countries need to be considered, impacting potential user adoption and infrastructure requirements.  Adapting the platform's communication strategies to local languages and preferences is crucial for success.  Competition from existing delivery platforms also needs evaluation in each target market, requiring tailored pricing and value propositions.",

        "mvp": "Focus on a single, densely populated city within a specific Latin American country (e.g., Santiago, Chile or Medell\u00edn, Colombia) with strong e-commerce presence.  The MVP should concentrate on partnering with 3-5 high-value retailers in that city. This limits initial geographical scope and customer support needs.  The MVP should offer a core functionality: GPS tracking with alert system for irregularities, basic scheduling, and simplified communication tools between merchant, driver and customer (SMS based communication is recommended initially). Post-delivery feedback mechanisms to gauge customer and merchant satisfaction are critical for iterative improvements.  Prioritize integration with readily available local mapping and messaging APIs to reduce reliance on complex integrations.  Start with a manual review process for the initial deliveries and gradually integrate AI features.  This will generate real-world data for future AI model training, which allows to prove the business idea's validity and gather early-stage metrics."

We met almost six years ago while studying computer science at MIT, and have spent the last few months building &AI after discovering how much attorney time is spent on tedious and repetitive aspects of patent due diligence. tl;dr &AI is a platform that streamlines patent due diligence. By using AI to understand the inventive aspects of patents and automate the creation of work products, we enable attorneys to instantly and comprehensively find prior art, produce robust claim language, invalidate weak patents, and more. \u274c The Problem Imagine a law firm is tasked with determining the strength of a patent or set of patent claims. This is an everyday problem for patent attorneys and could be for anything from a patent application to an IP litigation case. To start, the attorneys need to conduct a prior art search. Typically, either:  The attorneys meet with an outsourced search provider and give them their claims and features of interest. After a week or two, the provider returns with 5-10 reasonable documents, charging up to $10k. The attorneys manually use boolean keyword searches through databases like Google Patents and decades-old legal research platforms. Over the course of 10-20 billed hours, they have found 5-10 reasonable documents.  In either case, they have already contributed a massive amount of resources to this project without much validation that they are going in the right direction. With their prior art in hand, the attorneys must evaluate the claims with respect to the art. This involves drafting work products like claim charts, which require several read-throughs of each document to identify and map the relevant language over the course of 20-40 billed hours. By now, the attorneys should have a good idea of the strength of the claims, whether they need to be revised, and whether they may be invalid. What if they haven\u2019t found the invalidating art? They repeat the process. Over and over again, for every patent, for every case. Due diligence can continue almost indefinitely, and it\u2019s only limited by attorney time and client budgets. \u2705 The Solution Now, imagine the law firm is using &AI. Upon receiving the patent or claims, they find the invalidating prior art and export comprehensive claim charts in seconds! &AI enables both attorneys and inventors to conduct their patent due diligence at a speed, scale, and quality that has never before been possible. In minutes, we can analyze and compare the inventive aspects of thousands of patents, allowing attorneys to spend less time on tedious work and more time developing their arguments. We\u2019ve built our platform to be broadly applicable and easy to use. Users can leverage our AI for patent applications, responses to office actions, and invalidity, with use cases of freedom to operate, infringement, and portfolio analysis coming soon.  \ud83e\udd32 The Ask We\u2019re actively looking to onboard more tech-forward law firms and company in-houses working with patents. We\u2019d also love to hear directly from individual patent applicants and owners about how our tools might serve them. If you\u2019re interested, please connect with us at founders@tryandai.com and we\u2019d love to talk about working together! ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "The &AI platform presents a compelling proposition, but its feasibility in the Latin American market requires careful consideration.  While the need for efficient patent due diligence is universal, the market size for sophisticated AI-powered legal tech solutions in Hispanic countries is significantly smaller than in the US.  Many law firms, especially smaller ones, may lack the resources and technological infrastructure to adopt such a platform.  Cultural factors also play a role; legal processes and technological adoption rates vary considerably across Latin American nations.  Economic constraints may limit the willingness to invest in a premium-priced service like this, especially in the initial stages.

In the US today, retailers spend approximately $10B per year paying human laborers to pick up and move cardboard boxes in warehouses. Existing solutions for automating this are expensive and difficult to install, which is why manual operation is still so prevalent.  Our solution is different. We make swarms of small mobile robots that install into existing warehouses to provide a low-cost and robust automation solution for case picking and mixed-SKU palletization.

CTO - Eric has extensive experience creating hardware, electronics, and software for modern robotics systems, including five years at Skydio, founding and growing the Autonomy Infrastructure team. The Problem Case picking for order selecting, a critical task in the supply chain for grocery stores, retail, and restaurants, remains largely manual in U.S. warehouses. We estimate that over 30 billion cases are manually moved between pallets annually, resulting in labor costs exceeding $10 billion each year. Current automation solutions are prohibitively expensive and fall into two main categories:  Build a new warehouse with extensive conveyor belt systems, industrial robot arms, and high-density case storage. Costs range from $100M to $350M per warehouse. Install large mobile robots that directly replace humans in existing warehouses at a cost of $300k to $500k per unit. This high capital expenditure and long ROI period make them infeasible for many businesses.  Our Solution Is Fundamentally Different We've developed a way to retrofit existing warehouse infrastructure with swarms of affordable, agile robots to automate the order-selecting process. This approach eliminates the need to rebuild warehouses from scratch or invest in expensive large mobile robots. We are designing our system to:  Meet or exceed your current throughput\u2014our robots work in swarms, easily picking tens of thousands of cases per shift.

While the need for efficient logistics is undeniable, several factors limit the immediate feasibility of AutoPallet's solution.  The high initial investment cost, even with a claimed lower price point compared to existing solutions, remains a barrier for many Latin American businesses, particularly SMEs which form the bulk of the market.  Furthermore, the technical infrastructure in many warehouses might not support the sophisticated technology required.  The reliance on advanced AI and robotics also poses a hurdle; skilled labor in this domain is scarce and expensive in the region.

Go Bears!Mihir PatilOverstand Labs\u00a0Company LaunchesOverstand - The platform for upselling your enterprise accountsTLDR: Overstand helps enterprise software teams maximize revenue by reading all customer communication channels (chat, email, call recordings, support tickets) to uncover opportunities for contract expansion. The problem: Big tech companies know that one of the best ways to increase revenue is to bring more value to existing customers. But customer account management involves not just sales, but also support, customer success, implementation teams, and so on. Customers might voice problems that are not conveyed in a timely manner (or at all!) to those responsible for expanding the account. Enterprise software companies are leaving a lot of potential revenue on the table\u2014 some offer a whole menu of products, with each enterprise customer only taking advantage of one or a few of the offerings. The solution: Overstand is designed to read all customer communications and flag opportunities for expansion of customer accounts. It identifies hidden expansion opportunities that are buried in customer communications by analyzing every single message and comparing it to product docs and even existing use cases at other enterprise accounts.   The team:  We met at Palantir several years ago and both recognized the importance of empowering customer-facing teams to fully understand and sell highly technical and complex products. Mihir was a PM and engineering lead at Palantir and often felt that many existing customers could have further benefited from using his products.

However, its success hinges on several factors. The market size for enterprise software is growing in Latin America, particularly in larger economies like Brazil and Mexico.  However, adoption rates may be lower than in North America or Europe due to economic constraints and varying levels of digital maturity across the region.  Cultural nuances are also important;  building trust with enterprise clients will be critical, and the solution's implementation needs to be adaptable to diverse communication styles and languages.  Economic factors like budget constraints and a preference for localized solutions will need to be addressed.  The platform's multilingual capabilities and scalability across varying technological infrastructures will directly impact its market penetration.",

No engineer likes going through mountains of files to find the right spots where they want to make changes and then do the complicated plumbing to make those changes work. Haystack is a standalone code editor that makes this much faster so engineers can focus on actually writing code. In Haystack, users can explore and edit their code on a 2D canvas with a navigational copilot assisting them every step of the way.  Our Ask: Engineers have really enjoyed the smooth experience of editing their codebase in Haystack. Join them at https://haystackeditor.com! It takes just a single click to import your VS Code extensions and settings, so you can get to coding straight away. Hi everyone! We\u2019re Akshay Subramaniam and Jake Yatvitskiy, and we\u2019re building Haystack.  The Problem: Haystack was born out of our frustrations with working in large and mature codebases, specifically with navigating and editing functional flows. A great example of a functional flow is the code flow for adding an item to the Amazon shopping cart \u2014 from the database layer all the way to the frontend UI. Oftentimes dealing with such flows would involve navigating a maze of files and functions, and making any edits would involve a lengthy process of doing corresponding downstream/upstream plumbing.  The Solution: Haystack attempts to address this in the following ways:  It allows you to explore your codebase as a directed graph of functions, classes, etc, on the canvas. We feel like this better fits how your mind understands your codebase and helps you find and alter functional flows more intuitively. It has a navigational copilot that makes edits across files or functions much easier. After you make some changes, Haystack will try to predict your next action and create functions/methods or refactor upstream/downstream code for you. Haystack will surface these speculative edits on the canvas in a way that you can easily dismiss or incorporate them, allowing you to make large-scale changes with a few clicks or keystrokes.

        "feasibility_analysis": "The Pinnacle RCS API presents a unique opportunity within the Latin American market, but its success hinges on several factors.  The market size for developers utilizing messaging APIs is substantial, especially considering the prevalence of mobile communication in the region. However,  the adoption of RCS is dependent on carrier support and consumer device penetration of iOS 18 and compatible Android versions. This varies significantly across Latin American countries; some markets may be significantly slower to adopt.  Cultural nuances impact messaging styles and app usage; therefore, localization and tailored marketing efforts are crucial. Economic factors also play a role; pricing models need to be competitive and accessible to various developer budgets within the diverse economic landscape of Latin America.

Konstructly not only streamlines manual processes and provides unparalleled visibility, it drives productivity from contractors\u2019 supply chains using the ultimate incentive - cash. Team \ud83d\udc77\ud83d\udc77\ud83d\udc77 Hi everyone, we\u2019re Dima, John, and Stefan, and we\u2019re on a mission to prevent overspend in construction. We\u2019re doing this by \u2018following the money\u2019 and mapping payments directly to their corresponding works on-site.   The Problem \u274c In construction, Production\u2014 those doing and managing the build on-site\u2014 are disconnected from Commercial, those responsible for the project\u2019s finances and profitability.   This ultimately results in overspending.   For example, quantity surveyors spend 25-50% of their time processing subcontractor invoices, mostly because they don\u2019t have the necessary data on hand. They also spend a lot of time on low-value, manual tasks like data entry. This means that they spend less time on high-value tasks like tendering and procurement, where oversights result in costly mistakes.   Lack of visibility means that a lot of stuff gets swept under the carpet, only to resurface at the end of a project (eg. variations). It also means that subcontractors are less accountable as it\u2019s more difficult to prove things, resulting in reduced productivity, more rework, and longer delays.  The Solution \u2705 A single app connecting Production and Commercial stakeholders, entities, and workflows, to save time, increase visibility and incentivize productivity.  How It Works \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Subcontractors\u2019 site teams log their progress for approval/QA by the general contractor\u2019s (GC) site team and for handover acceptance by the next trade. This progress auto-fills their applications, saving their commercial team a lot of time. The GC\u2019s commercial team then just has to amend/review as necessary in a simple, purpose-built interface, with all the production data visible (progress, QA, handover acceptance). It makes valuing and approving the subcontractor\u2019s work a lot quicker and provides much more control/visibility. This incentivizes subcontractors to build the right first time (productivity) as GCs can more easily identify inadequacies and withhold payments until works/tasks are performed properly, in their entirety.  Recorded Handovers are extremely powerful - general contractors are finally able to capture responsible parties and quantify delays, allowing them to enforce liquidated damages or, at the very least, have more leverage in final account negotiation. This encourages prompt and correct behavior from both parties, once again relying on cash to drive productivity.  How We Came Across the Problem \ud83d\udca1 Stefan previously built and operated a construction labor marketplace.   He handled invoicing and payments between the subcontractor and contractor, needing to manually unify all the different document formats (photos of handwritten statements, WhatsApp lists, emails, word docs, spreadsheets, etc) and manage the endless back and forth between multiple stakeholders - who all had different opinions on what work had been done and how much should be paid!   Not only was the submission and approval process extremely inefficient, but there was no visibility over the corresponding works or their quality checks, massively increasing risk and friction between the parties. Something had to change!  Our Ask \ud83d\ude4f Connect us with relevant constructions peeps! eg. Those at general contractors/house builders turning over $20m/year.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Konstructly addresses a significant pain point in the Latin American construction industry: inefficient payment processes and lack of transparency.  The market size is substantial, given the prevalence of smaller to medium-sized construction firms across Hispanic countries. However, successful implementation requires careful consideration of several factors.  Firstly, digital adoption varies significantly across regions; therefore, a phased rollout targeting more digitally advanced areas initially might be necessary. Secondly, cultural nuances regarding trust and communication within construction teams need to be acknowledged and addressed through localized user interfaces and potentially in-person support.  Thirdly, economic factors, including varying payment cycles and financial capabilities of subcontractors, must influence the pricing strategy and payment integration options.  Finally, integrating with existing accounting systems and local legal frameworks related to construction contracts will be crucial. This requires extensive localized market research and potentially partnerships with local construction industry players.",

This would involve: (1) Partnering with a single general contractor (GC) to pilot the system with one or two subcontractors. (2) Developing a simplified version of the platform with core features such as progress tracking, photo/video upload for work verification, and invoice generation/approval. (3) Prioritizing a user-friendly interface with clear instructions in Spanish. (4) Focusing on data security and compliance with local regulations. This streamlined MVP allows for iterative feedback and adjustment based on real-world usage in the Latin American context.  Post-MVP, expansion could involve adding functionalities, supporting additional project types and languages, and integrating with more local payment gateways."

Using\u00a0DraftAid, teams can automate this process with a single click and:  Save considerable time Direct their focus toward more value-added tasks Cut down on drawing errors, preventing expensive manufacturing mistakes  The problem Modern design teams initiate their design by 3D modeling. To get their design manufactured, they need to make 2D drawings that look something like this:  Making 2D drawings for what\u2019s already been modeled in 3D takes up considerable time and energy. Design teams find themselves stuck investing 40% of their time in this manual task. This causes project delays while keeping talented designers busy doing repetitive tasks. Like any other repetitive manual task, making drawings can also be quite error-prone. Even with accurate designs, errors often sneak in and are only found when fixing them is an expensive endeavor. Enter DraftAid: Our innovation streamlines the drafting process making it as effortless as a single click. Once engineers complete their 3D design, a single click swiftly produces a manufacturing-ready 2D drawing within seconds. The resulting drawing is entirely editable, allowing engineers to make any necessary adjustments before sending it off for manufacturing. DraftAid allows teams to slash their current drawing time by up to 90% and eliminate common drawing errors. This not only enhances efficiency but also ensures consistency in drawings throughout the company, improving overall readability.  Meet the Power Trio: We are Mohammed, Abdullah, and Tahsin, a formidable team with a bond forged over three dynamic years of collaboration.

The Problem Most developers tell us they think of security as an afterthought, added out of fear rather than part of the development process at the start. This is because current security tools can\u2019t find critical business logic vulnerabilities, which are the ones attackers actually exploit, and instead flag low-priority issues with many false positives. This makes fixing these issues slow and costly, pulling engineers away from building features that grow revenue.

It also helps you understand the risk of these vulnerabilities and applies a working fix to continuously keep your code secure. Watch our demo here!   Technical Details At a high level, Gecko mimics the approach of skilled security experts by using LLM agents combined with program analysis tools like static analyzers, fuzzers, and symbolic executors, which were previously only used in intelligence agencies. For fixing vulnerabilities, Gecko uses multiple agents to iteratively refine the patches - ensuring the vulnerability is remediated, and your code isn\u2019t broken.

The founders met at UC Berkeley, and at our last jobs, we saw that the best sales reps weren\u2019t just great at selling\u2014they were elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies.   However, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals.  Mica\u2019s agents reduce that time to less than a minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer.

TLDR: Mica helps B2B sales teams close more deals by automating their entire sales follow-up process. Our AI agents analyze sales calls, generate tailored collateral, and follow up with prospects until the deal is closed. The Problem: The best sales reps aren\u2019t just great at selling\u2014they are elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks, 1-pagers, and product demos to help champions advocate internally. However, creating this content often takes over 30 minutes per call, and with multiple calls a day, even the best reps can only prioritize a few clients, leaving others with subpar follow-ups and millions in lost deals. Our Solution: Mica automates the sales follow-up process by generating deal-closing collateral in less than a minute. Our AI analyzes sales calls, extracts key insights, builds tailored collateral, and sends this to prospects in a centralized deal summary page.  Key Benefits  Quicker Follow-up Time:\u00a0Mica creates personalized follow ups in under 1 minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer. Faster Sales Cycles:\u00a0The point of contact can easily review important information from the call, share it internally, and make decisions faster.  How it Works  Upload: Mica automatically pulls in your sales call from existing recording or notetaking tools. Extract Key Insights: Mica identifies the key points the prospect was most interested in. Generate Tailored Collateral: Mica creates tailored decks, product demos, and 1-pagers for each key topic. Share: Mica generates a shareable link containing all the collateral, which can be sent directly to the prospect in follow-up emails that Mica also creates.

Current antibiotics stop working because bacteria evolve resistance to them. Our approach leverages co-evolutionary protein-protein interaction datasets combined with AI to forecast bacterial mutations and create \u2018future-proof\u2019 antibiotics, addressing antibiotic resistance before it develops. This changes the game for how frequently we\u2019ll need to make new antibiotics and how long our new antibiotics will be able to treat patients. Let's get into more detail: \u274c What\u2019s the problem? Antibiotic resistance is a looming global health crisis:  \u2620 Already killing more people than Malaria and HIV \ud83d\udcc8 Getting exponentially worse because of bacterial resistance \ud83d\udcb8 $100 trillion economic burden undermining modern medicine   \u2705 We solve this by making future-proof antibiotics that:  \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642 Stay ahead of bacterial mutations to prevent resistance \ud83c\udfaf Precisely target harmful bacteria without disrupting beneficial microbes \ud83d\udcb5 Overcome the economic challenges of antibiotic development   Our Science Traditional trial-and-error discovery cannot compete with bacteria's ability to mutate and acquire resistance genes. Our evolutionary datasets and AI will allow us to stay one step ahead of bacteria. We don\u2019t react, we anticipate:  You might wonder whether bacteria would eventually be able to mutate in other ways around our antibiotics. Well, yes, they could, but our approach forces all the escape mutations to be extremely costly. In fact, so costly that the bacteria wouldn\u2019t survive. How? Our experiments are like running a battle simulation hundreds of times to find enemies\u2019 weak points. This means that we can create detailed maps of the co-evolutionary landscapes of bacteria and our antibiotics so that we can ultimately engineer medicines with a low propensity for resistance emergence. Watch how that works:   We then engineer our antibiotics for stability and safety inside the human body using a suite of protein AI models (both diffusion and language model-based). This engineering means our antibiotics 1) only target pathogenic bacteria and not human cells or microbiomes and\u00a02) have the potential to be given as a single dose \u2013 reducing the amount of monitoring that doctors have to do on patients. This is in contrast to current antibiotics, which can have human cell toxicity, disrupt microbiomes, and have to be dosed every few hours.  \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2695\ufe0f Why doctors are excited Our blueprints have the potential for:  Low drug-drug interactions Low risk of C. difficile infection Low dosing regimes Low risk of resistance emergence Low side effect profile  \ud83d\udcca Evolvere Bio Factfile  \ud83e\uddea We have already synthesized molecules that specifically kill bacteria in physiological conditions.

These simulations can tell us whether a drug is going to bind to a protein or how quickly a drug will act once it is consumed by a patient.  Our Team  We are a team from the University of Cambridge with 30+ years of combined experience in AI and Molecular Modelling, including:  Javier, who scaled probabilistic AI methods 1000x during his PhD, turned down a research scientist position in Big Tech to start Angstrom AI. Laurence, who developed FAB, a method for training AIs from physical equations without training data, during his PhD and was a researcher at InstaDeep before its acquisition by BioNTech in 2023. Miguel, Javier and Laurence's PhD supervisor, author of foundational research on AI for drug discovery and generative modeling. Gabor, who developed MACE, a state of the art quantum mechanically accurate force field.  Miguel and Gabor's work has been cited over 40k times. The Problem During drug discovery and development, pharmaceutical companies need to understand how drug molecules interact with other molecules in the human body to determine the drugs\u2019 efficacy and safety. Conventional methods to assess molecular interactions are unsatisfactory:  Wet lab experiments are accurate but slow and expensive. Machine learning prediction methods, like AlphaFold, are fast but inaccurate. They are limited by the quality and quantity of training data, which must be generated by lab experiments. Molecular Dynamics simulates interactions by rolling out the equations of physics, offering a balance between wet lab and machine learning predictions in accuracy and speed. These factors depend on the model of physics used. More accurate models are more expensive to run. This makes the method compute bottlenecked rather than data bottlenecked.  Here is a video of a simulation of 64 water molecules. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18AuJEVnwWA   Solution: Fast and Accurate Molecular Simulations We run molecular simulations, keeping us in the compute constrained regime, but we combine 1) quantum mechanically accurate models of physics 2) generative AI that allows us to run these models quickly.   We use the MACE (multi-atomic cluster expansion) physics model, which accurately reproduces quantum-mechanical interactions. It was developed by Gabor, our co-founder. In collaboration with our academic partners, we recently showed MACE simulations are the first ever to provide accuracy comparable to lab experiments when estimating the hydration-free energies (a quantity relevant to drug bioavailability). Below is a plot from the resulting publication. However, MACE is computationally expensive, each of the results from the below plot required 1 week of compute on 8 A100 GPUs.    We use diffusion models to accelerate MACE simulations, making them computationally affordable. Our models generate states consistent with physics, but the transitions between states are non-physical and significantly faster. Here is a video of our AI simulating the same water box as above.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK1MNLsQg2Y   Demos! Here are a couple of examples to show off the type of stuff you can do with our generative models. Speeding up Supercool Water Supercool water\u2014liquid water below freezing, here at -40\u00b0C\u2014is notoriously difficult to simulate with traditional methods because cold molecules move slower. The plot below shows the correlation between water molecule orientations across simulation steps. Our AI introduces about 10,000 times more information per step compared to traditional simulations.  Hydrating Methane Modeling interactions between molecules and water allows us to calculate how quickly the molecules will dissolve and their bioavailability as drugs. Here are videos of a traditional simulation of a methane molecule interacting with water and our AI simulation. Our AI prioritizes the movement of the methane molecule and its surrounding water, which are the parts that matter for solubility and bioavailability calculations. https://youtu.be/EmTit8tC0TE\u00a0 \u00a0   https://youtu.be/pq6Al2SATlg   These are the first ever genAI accelerated, physically accurate molecular dynamics simulations incorporating the interaction of many molecules. We are scaling up - so stay tuned!

        "feasibility_analysis": "Angstrom AI's technology presents a significant challenge for the Latin American market.  While the need for faster and more efficient drug discovery is universal, the high technical complexity and substantial computational resources required limit its immediate applicability in the region.  The target market (large pharmaceutical companies) is limited in Latin America compared to North America or Europe.  Furthermore, the cultural nuances are less of a direct factor than the economic and infrastructural limitations.  A successful implementation would require significant investment in computational infrastructure and highly specialized talent, which may not be readily available or cost-effective in many Hispanic countries.  The potential exists, but it requires a phased approach and likely a focus on collaborations with larger international players already present in the region.",

We fix that.  \ud83e\udd75\u00a0PROBLEM: Companies selling physical products struggle with accounting and inventory operations. Current bookkeeping methods rely heavily on manual input and are often disconnected from accurate inventory data. This leads to mistakes in important financial figures like cost of goods sold (COGS), inventory value, margins, and cash flow. As a result, businesses spend a lot of time and money only to gain an inaccurate picture of their financial health. These inaccuracies lead to poor budgeting decisions, loan rejections, failed fundraising, non-compliance, and frequent cash flow crises. \ud83d\ude0d\u00a0OUR SOLUTION: A powerful AI accounting agent built specifically for companies selling physical products. Our platform automates bookkeeping and completes a variety of crucial product operations tasks such as calculating COGS, optimizing POs, and conducting contribution margin analysis with only a few clicks. All financial and inventory data is connected and written back to QBO or your ERP, eliminating financial statement errors, saving dozens of hours per month, and thousands on accounting costs.  \ud83d\udca1\u00a0THE INSPIRATION: As the founder of Robin Golf, Peter encountered this problem frequently. Doing the financials required an expensive team and the books were always inexplicably wrong. As as a result, the company was underwritten for debt and equity incorrectly, wasn\u2019t able to make proper budgeting decisions, couldn\u2019t forecast inventory needs, couldn\u2019t optimize channel mix, and was blindsided by cash shortfalls.  \ud83d\udc6c\u00a0THE TEAM: Peter Marler\u00a0(CEO) was the co-founder/CEO of Robin Golf, a venture backed, multichannel golf equipment company.

Tandem is an AI-enabled office leasing platform. We\u2019re using technology to unlock flexible, month-to-month agreements in quality, ready-to-go spaces.   Our AI co-pilot enables a white-glove-quality B2B office search experience, with a fraction of the human labor typically required.  Today we\u2019re serving two primary markets \u2014 NY & SF, with hundreds of active Hosts in each.

Whereas a typical office search takes 3-6 months, Tandem\u2019s platform gets it done in 14 days or less. Since launching in NYC & SF earlier this year, the team has helped >100 companies find off-market space, paying out >$1M in rent through its platform. https://youtu.be/0pRqRy4Q0iI      Hey everyone, we\u2019re building Tandem: a marketplace to help companies flexibly lease office space. \u274c The Problem Renting an office is expensive and hard. Here\u2019s how the traditional process works: hire a broker, tour options for months, hire a lawyer to review a lease, sign for a 1-5 year minimum term, hire another broker to sublease the space when you outgrow it, repeat. COVID has left US offices half as full as they were in 2019 and resulted in landlords sitting on $500B+ in losses. This means tons of excess space that both landlords and companies are paying for, but because the traditional process is so tedious, they have no way of offering it flexibly - the way tenants these days want it. \ud83d\udd0d The Solution Tandem is a new type of office marketplace that uses AI-powered workflows to help companies list, discover, and pay for new office space.  Lower transaction costs mean shorter lease terms \u2014 Tandem customers can trade spaces, upsize or downsize, with as little as 30 days notice. https://youtu.be/zCSB2izcjbY   To provide access to unique supply, Tandem helps top companies rent out office space in iconic buildings (e.g., the World Trade Center), almost like a long-term Airbnb for a business. Hosts can list their excess space on our marketplace, and our platform will coordinate tours with prospective teams, manage legal, and process rent payments. Companies looking for space can browse off-market options, meet interesting Hosts, pay rent through our platform, and maintain flexible month-to-month contracts. \u2728 Community fave offices We have 200+ offices across New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with more than 100 companies actively sharing.

        "feasibility_analysis": "The Tandem concept presents a significant opportunity in the Latin American market, particularly in major cities experiencing growth and evolving office dynamics.  However, successful implementation requires careful consideration of several factors. Market size is substantial in countries like Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, where significant commercial real estate exists.  Cultural nuances are crucial; the platform needs to be adapted to local business practices, communication styles, and levels of technology adoption.  Economic factors, including fluctuating currencies and varying levels of digital infrastructure across different countries, also need to be addressed. A phased rollout targeting specific, high-growth cities with strong internet penetration would be advisable.  Furthermore, adapting the platform to include Spanish language support and local payment gateway integrations is essential. The competition may include existing real estate agencies but the focus on short-term, flexible leasing makes Tandem unique and potentially appealing to a broader range of businesses in a region where traditional long-term contracts might be less desirable for many startups and small businesses.",

        "feasibility_analysis": "Upshift's platform for building plugin systems faces significant challenges in the Latin American market. While the need for extensible software exists across all regions, the target audience (mid-sized businesses and fast-growing startups) is smaller in Latin America compared to North America or Europe.  Furthermore, many companies in the region might prioritize cost-effective, simpler solutions over sophisticated plugin systems. The higher technical expertise required by both the platform provider and its users presents a hurdle.  Economic factors, such as budget constraints and a potential lack of developer talent specialized in this area, could also limit adoption. Cultural nuances are less directly relevant to the core technology but influence market adoption; clear and localized communication will be crucial. The existing infrastructure might also be a limiting factor.  While there's a growing tech scene in Latin America,  it's not as mature as in other regions.

This seemingly inevitable tradeoff affects millions of content creators trying to stand out with their thumbnail designs, the critical window to connect with their audience. If you\u2019ve had to design thumbnails for social channels, you've likely been here:  You have a great idea, so you install the latest Adobe product.

Export designs in channel-specific dimensions Quick demo here   Our story: As a design and engineer duo, we have spent years crafting creative tools in the WebGL and AR space. We've also built and mentored in the no-code space to help non-techies build out their online presence. Regardless of the domain, one challenge persists for creators \u2014 finding a design tool that\u2019s both simple and powerful enough to bring a brand's vision to life. The reason why this problem persists in the market is simple - the inevitable tradeoff that every design software needs to make between power and ease of use. Typically, the more powerful a tool gets, the more complex it becomes. On the flip side, easy-to-use tools often limit creativity with rigid templates. But with AI, we have found the conviction to break this tradeoff. We are on a mission to create a design tool that actually puts your ideas in the driving seat, making the design process less about esoteric design language and more about the content team\u2019s own creative impulses. Our goal is to empower the next generation of creators to build stunning brands and assets. Our ask Are you currently on a team that regularly has to come up with thumbnail designs for your social media content?\u00a0 Either wrestling with complex design tools or unhappy with generic templates? Talk to us, and we would love to learn more about your requirements! If you know any professional content creators, we\u2019d really appreciate the connection! Our email is founders@ideate.xyz ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Ideate.xyz presents a compelling opportunity within the Latin American market.  The demand for efficient and affordable graphic design solutions is high, particularly among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and content creators who may lack dedicated design resources.  However, several factors require consideration.  While the concept of AI-powered design tools is gaining traction globally, internet penetration and digital literacy vary across Latin American countries.  Therefore, a successful launch requires focusing on countries with higher digital adoption rates and tailoring the marketing strategy to reflect the local language and cultural context.  Pricing models need to be competitive and accessible to a diverse range of users, including those operating on tighter budgets.  The platform's success hinges on the quality of its AI and its ability to understand and adapt to the visual preferences of diverse Latin American audiences.  Overcoming language barriers in user interaction with the AI is critical. Offering multilingual support is crucial for market penetration.",

The MVP should be tested in a specific Latin American country (e.g., Mexico, Colombia, or Argentina) known for its strong digital market and relatively high internet penetration.  Initial user feedback will be crucial to refining the AI's understanding of local design styles and preferences.

High-volume, high-turnover roles are common across various sectors, and the challenges of unbiased, efficient hiring are amplified in regions with potentially less standardized HR practices.

Cultural nuances around communication styles and interview expectations must be carefully considered to ensure the AI interviewer is perceived as fair and effective.  Economic factors, such as the cost of skilled labor and access to technology, will impact adoption rates.  A phased rollout, starting with larger companies in more technologically advanced Latin American countries, is advisable.

ESOPs are a federal retirement plan that enable businesses to give their employees a stake in the company in exchange for significant tax benefits.   With 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners set to retire in the coming years, there's a growing \"Silver Tsunami\" of businesses across the country in search of new ownership. For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.  By selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of \u2014 things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire \u2014 imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire.   Thousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth. We're excited about the opportunity to massively grow these numbers by making it simple for every business to become employee owned.Latest News13 companies from YC Demo Day 1 that are worth paying attention to | TechCrunchSep 25, 2024Village LabsFounded:2023Team Size:2Location:New YorkGroup Partner:Dalton Caldwell\u00a0Active FoundersRoger Cawdette, Co-Founder & CEOI'm the co-founder & CEO at Village Labs where we're building software for ESOPs. Our hope is that by creating great products and technology for ESOPs, we\u2019ll be able to expand employee ownership across America.  Before this, I co-founded Finary (YC W21) where we were building a social network for the stock market (before WallStreetBets went viral!). I studied Technological & Social Innovation at Harvard and left after my sophomore year to do YC.Roger CawdetteVillage Labs\u00a0Turja Chowdhury, Co-Founder & CTOCo-founder and CTO @ Village LabsTurja ChowdhuryVillage Labs\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesVillage Labs - We help America\u2019s businesses become employee owned  Hello YC community & world,  It\u2019s an exciting time! Turja and I are building Village Labs, a new firm that helps businesses become employee-owned by helping them set up and manage an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).  ESOPs are federal retirement plans that enable companies to give their employees shares in the business in exchange for major tax benefits. They are NOT stock option plans, and no, we are NOT doing cap table management!  EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP WILL BE BIG There are currently about 6,000 companies with an ESOP across the country \u2014 the popular names include Publix Supermarkets, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology (the maker of those black, blue, and green trash bins you see on every street in SF).  Employee ownership has been around for decades in America, but there\u2019s going to be an explosion in the number of employee-owned businesses that are created in the next few years. There are a couple of reasons for this:  The Silver Tsunami: 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners are going to sell their businesses in the next few years. Many of them will sell to their employees because they get a fair price, tax benefits, and the comfort of knowing their employees will be taken care of - things not guaranteed by traditional buyers like private equity. Government support: Congress and state legislatures are passing more legislation to encourage the creation of ESOPs. This largely looks like more tax benefits for ESOP businesses and owners who sell to an ESOP. Mainstream awareness: There\u2019s been a surge in awareness of employee ownership in the last few years because of new press coverage. See:\u00a0Pete Stavros on 60 Minutes,\u00a0Blackstone announcing its employee ownership initiative,\u00a0major businesses announcing becoming employee owned.   WHAT IS VILLAGE LABS DOING? At Village Labs, we\u2019re setting out to help create as many employee-owned businesses as possible. In terms of what we do, we help owners sell to their employees via an ESOP and then provide them with the tools they need to manage their plans.   HOW YOU CAN HELP Most business owners don\u2019t know that selling to their employees is an option (and one that commonly comes with the most financial benefits). We\u2019re working to change that by building a nationwide network of partners with close connections to the many Boomer business owners who will retire soon. We work with these partners to educate owners on selling to their employees.  If you\u2019d like to help, you could introduce us to\u2026  Owners and executives at mid-sized businesses with 20+ employees and stable cash flows Business brokerage firms (e.g. Transworld, Sunbelt Brokers, etc.) Exit/estate planning firms + wealth managers  And if you happen to be one of these, we\u2019d love to talk to you.  WHY WE\u2019RE EXCITED ABOUT EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP The short answer is that being employee-owned is just a better way of doing business.  Here\u2019s the story of CHI Overhead Doors, a garage door manufacturer in rural Illinois. They\u2019re not an ESOP, but their story highlights what makes employee ownership so awesome.       This isn\u2019t an isolated, one-off thing. There are many stories out there of businesses that benefited from becoming employee-owned - and we\u2019ve seen them personally. Turja and I have been on the road for a lot of YC this summer, visiting employee-owned businesses in places like Portland, Tuscon, and other cities across the country. One of the main things you notice is that the employees are noticeably happier, and the quality of service is excellent - likely because the employees have ownership in the business and, therefore, an incentive to see it succeed. It\u2019s the same reason we, as founders, give shares to our employees.  Considering 70% of Americans don\u2019t like their jobs, and ~50% have no retirement savings, we think widespread employee ownership would bring those numbers down. That\u2019s why our goal is to create as many employee-owned businesses as possible. That means more people who enjoy their jobs, more retirement savings, and a more productive economy.  Again, most people don\u2019t know that employee ownership is a thing, but wouldn\u2019t we all be better off if they did? If you\u2019d like to help us with this or are just curious to learn more, please do reach out!  Thanks for reading!  -Roger & Turja Company Photo",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Adapting the Village Labs ESOP model to the Hispanic Latin American market presents significant challenges.  The concept of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) is largely unfamiliar in this context, where family-owned businesses and informal economies are prevalent.  Market size for this service would be limited to larger, more formal companies, primarily in the more developed economies within the region (e.g., parts of Mexico, Chile, and possibly Colombia).  Cultural nuances regarding employee ownership, trust in investment schemes, and tax regulations differ substantially from the US.  Economic factors like fluctuating currencies and the prevalence of smaller, family-run businesses would limit the immediate addressable market.  Significant educational efforts would be needed to explain ESOPs and their benefits, overcoming potential language barriers and skepticism.",

How We Help Our platform is more than a bank; it\u2019s a comprehensive financial operating system designed to help nonprofits streamline operations, maximize resources, and ensure financial transparency.  Unified Finances: Bank with high-interest bearing accounts and integrate donations, spending, budgets, and compliance under one roof. Spend Management: Create customizable cards with limits and approvals to monitor all spend. Streamlined Payments: Replace Venmo and costly donation tools with our fee-free payment, donation, and reimbursement links. Fiscal Sponsorship and Granting Tools: Create easily accessible accounts for supported programs, and manage team member accesses in one click. Automated Compliance: Keep your organization on track with automatic custom reporting and annual filings.   Who We Are Matt is a Harvard alum and formerly founded a fintech startup.

I wrote flight software for the Mars Sample Return Lander at NASA JPL and developed embedded control systems for laser communication at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I studied computer engineering at the University of Michigan.Elham IslamSynnax\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesSynnax - The software infrastructure for operating & observing complex hardwareSummary Teams operating hardware from rockets to manufacturing lines use outdated, unintuitive control software that disregards the importance of rapid, quality data processing. This leads to unexpected downtime, disastrous anomalies, and delayed development.  Synnax delivers a modern mission control stack with integrated data storage & processing. Wrap LabVIEW, Snowflake, and Grafana into a single package, tune it for hardware, and you get Synnax. The Problem We\u2019re a group of Aerospace Engineers hailing from NASA JPL, SpaceX, and Firefly Aerospace. (From left to right: Patrick Dotson, Elham Islam, and Emiliano Bonilla)  We\u2019ve seen the best engineers blow up multi-million dollar systems because their mission control software didn\u2019t give them a comprehensive picture of how their hardware was behaving. A director of test & launch operations once told our team:  It\u2019s amazing what people guess at just because loading data is so hard  To put their quote in context, here\u2019s what the leading aerospace control software, LabVIEW, shows as a UI screenshot on their landing page:  Remember Scratch or Lego Mindstorms from elementary school? LabVIEW is kind of like that, except people use it to fly humans to space. LabVIEW and its cross industry counterparts (such as AVEVA Scada and Rockwell FactoryTalk) were first developed in the 20th century and have evolved little since. These tools come with:  Outdated, unintuitive user interfaces High price tags Closed ecosystems with no integrations Poor documentation Expensive certifications  Most importantly, they disregard the importance of tightly integrated and automated data processing that drives the innovation of today\u2019s software giants. Most solutions spit out massive CSV files or mindlessly write data to an SQL table. They\u2019re disorganized, difficult to locate, inaccessible to most engineers, and are challenging to integrate with analysis tools. Our Solution - The Product At Synnax, we\u2019re building a modern alternative to tools like LabVIEW by developing tightly integrated hardware control, sensor data storage, and automated post-processing software. Here\u2019s our UI:  We deliver:  Intuitive interfaces for humans to manually operate everything from automotive test stands to manufacturing lines. Tools for categorizing and reviewing historical data. Automated post-processing and report generation pipelines. Direct integration with existing sensor systems so teams don\u2019t need to buy new hardware. A simple API for writing automated control sequences in Python, C++, and TypeScript.  It\u2019s this easy to open a valve based on temperature in Synnax:  Here\u2019s a comparable sequence in LabVIEW:  Our Solution - The Tech We\u2019ve built one of the fastest time-series database engines available. Synnax can stream millions of samples per second in real time, making it possible to control systems with extremely tight timing requirements, such as starting a rocket engine. Our Solution - The Impact By bringing together hardware control and sensor data processing, organizations operating large, complex systems tighten the feedback loop between recording sensor data and using it to make actionable decisions. With Synnax, teams:  Reduce risk by detecting and reacting to anomalies in real time. Spend less time developing in-house data processing solutions. Reduce the manual labor involved in extracting insights from sensor data.  Our Asks Do you work on hardware and need updated control software? Do you know someone who does? Let us know at founders@synnaxlabs.com. Hear from the foundersHow did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)During his time in industry, Emiliano witnessed outdated control software and bad data review processes lead to multi-million dollar failures of critical path hardware. Frustrated with proprietary file formats, slow data pipelines, and unintuitive, complex tools like LabVIEW, he set out to built a modern control and data processing stack for hardware. Patrick and Elham were Emiliano\u2019s first beta testers on the University of Michigan\u2019s student rocketry team. They played an essential role in early iterations of the product, giving feedback through experience gained during their internships at SpaceX, NASA JPL, and MIT\u2019s Lincoln Labs. Over time, their conviction in the problem Synnax is solving and the quality of the product grew. In early 2024, they joined forces as co-founders. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Synnax's software addresses a significant need for modernizing industrial control systems, a market present across Latin America.  However, the target audience (large industrial firms, aerospace, manufacturing) is relatively small compared to consumer-focused markets.  Successful implementation hinges on identifying specific niches within the region (e.g., mining, energy, specific manufacturing sectors) with a demonstrated need for such advanced solutions.  Cultural nuances are less relevant than the technological infrastructure and technical expertise available within these target companies.  Economic factors will play a crucial role; convincing companies to adopt a new, potentially expensive system requires demonstrating a strong ROI, possibly through a phased implementation or a focus on cost savings through reduced downtime and improved efficiency.  The challenge lies in navigating the varying levels of technological adoption and digital maturity across different Latin American countries.",

Domain experts and engineers can now iterate 20x faster with prebuilt tools, API deployment, tracing, and more. Currently, prompting is mostly done by engineers inside the code base. This is just a coincidence, and it yields poor quality and a long iteration cycle due to communication overhead with domain experts. Wordware is the go-to tool for these cross-functional teams. Our clients range from AI tinkerers developing their ideas to large companies using Wordware as their whole LLM backend. It\u2019s a tool (an IDE) that enables you to quickly build custom AI agents for specific use cases, like legal contract generation, marketing content automation, invoice analysis, candidate screening, generating PRDs, and many more. We call applications built on Wordware \u2018WordApps\u2019 because you can create them using natural language\u2014in other words, using words (pun intended).  Our core belief is that the domain expert\u2014not the engineer\u2014knows what good LLM output looks like. For example, lawyers building legal SaaS need to be deeply involved in the process, and working directly in the codebase or going back and forth with engineers isn\u2019t the way to go. Most of our clients are cross-functional teams, including less technical members, who need to collaborate with engineers on LLM applications, such as assessing prompt outputs, and care about the speed of iterations.

Think of us like the MailChimp for WhatsApp, with a conversational AI twist. \u2014 Hi friends! We are Paul and Thomas, the founders behind Kiosk.  We connected at Hexa, the Startup Studio behind Front and Aircall, around the vision that we could greatly improve communication between people and businesses using WhatsApp and AI. Tom felt this problem at Yago, where he was CTO, and I saw WhatsApp's potential while working there. Context With >2.5 billion MAU, WhatsApp is an unmatched channel for brands to cultivate authentic and interactive relationships with customers. It combines the rich content of email (media, CTAs) with the open rates of SMS (>95%) in an interactive format! And the best is yet to come for businesses - with native payments and in-chat apps, it\u2019s quickly evolving to become the strongest customer engagement channel out there. We believe brands can finally offer an amazing customer experience, where they can:  Push personalised and interactive content (thanks to WhatsApp) Answer any question on the product, the brand, or their space, 24/7 in any language (thanks to AI)  Our Solution Most companies building on the WhatsApp Business API are complex, omnichannel connectors (think Twillio, Vonage, and GupShup\u2026). There are few options available for SMBs and Mid-Market companies wanting an easy solution to engage with their customers at scale. We are building an all-in-one WhatsApp solution and our vision relies on:  Turn key solutions to connect with customers at scale, on WhatsApp (send campaigns, build automations, deploy your AI assistant) Tools to build and manage your audience (entry points, opt and opt-out management) and WhatsApp account. Integrations with business tools (CRM, E-commerce Platform, Helpdesk)   By focusing on WhatsApp, we will allow companies to create the best experience - with all WhatsApp native features - for their customers and grow their business. There are multiple billion-dollar companies built on Email, SMS, and phone. We want to be the first one on top of WhatsApp because WhatsApp-enabled companies will win!

We\u2019re on a mission to boost developer productivity and satisfaction by automating the day-to-day tasks that bog down software engineers. Problem Software engineers are often assigned menial \u201cproduct quality\u201d tickets and bugs that require them to context-switch from more important, interesting work. 15-20% of all tickets in the typical 2-week sprint are chores like fixing bugs and polishing up UI. Additionally, there are similar tickets in every company\u2019s graveyard backlog that rarely ever get cleared. The result? A simple engineering task that should\u2019ve taken 15 minutes to complete sometimes ends up taking 3 weeks to get done, or not at all. While it makes sense for engineers to deprioritize these tasks, this work is important for ensuring that customers have a delightful, bug-free user experience. Janky UX on an ongoing basis causes \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d for customers, leading to churn.

With Tusk, engineers no longer need to context-switch to do something simple like adding a confirmation modal or fixing a page index bug for table pagination. How Tusk works  Simply assign a ticket to Tusk. Our AI agent will traverse your codebase for context and create a PR for the ticket. Tusk will regenerate code to address PR reviews left by engineers and errors in automated checks.

Beta: If your team deploys a preview environment for every PR, Tusk will do an end-to-end test of the change and record a testing video.  Our story  Sohil was previously a Senior Software Engineer at Aspire. Because of his product-mindedness, he was usually the first engineer to complete product quality tickets. Sohil was also the first person to tell you that these chores distracted him from working on more important tasks. Marcel was formerly a Product Manager for 6sense\u2019s AI email product. He often made product decisions that were outside of the initial PRD due to customer feedback. However, he risked distracting his engineers by pulling these ad hoc tickets into the current sprint.

Initially, the MVP should target a specific insurance type (e.g., auto insurance or health insurance) and should prioritize the translation of the platform and user interface into the local language.  A small team of bilingual claims processors should be recruited, initially without heavy reliance on the AI aspects, to validate the core claims processing model. Customer service processes must be adapted to the local context. Focus on building strong relationships with one or two key insurance partners to gather feedback and ensure smooth integration.  Metrics should prioritize efficient processing time and customer satisfaction scores."

Today, financial institutions use Greenboard to detect risk using AI and to rip out and replace the bad legacy back office tooling they have wanted to get rid of for years.  Greenboard's mission is to enable financial institutions to operate their back office teams at a higher standard, with half of the headcount.

Outside of work, Ed boulders and explores the NYC food scene.Edward SchemborGreenboard\u00a0Company LaunchesGreenboard \u2014 \"Rippling\" for financial compliance & operationsHi \ud83d\udc4b, we\u2019re Dave and Ed, cofounders of Greenboard. TLDR; Greenboard allows financial firms to consolidate financial compliance software onto a single, easy-to-use platform. Cost-savings and streamlined experience are often what drive customers to sign - but the real magic of Greenboard happens when we aggregate our customers\u2019 relevant data onto a single platform that uses AI to detect risk faster and more reliably than previously possible. If you\u2019re a fintech or compliance leader get in touch at founders@greenboard.io. The problem: financial compliance software is fragmented and bad. Maintaining compliance is hard. In addition to paying for software, financial firms currently hire expensive consultants and large compliance teams to help maintain compliance, but this isn\u2019t really working. Some recent examples:  ~$300M in fines handed out to big banks for not archiving communications $100M lawsuit between a regulated firm and their consultants over an egregious compliance violation  Our solution: consolidated, human-centric software to drive a culture of compliance. AI to detect risk faster and more reliably than ever before. Financial compliance teams today often pay for 2+ different software solutions for things like communications archiving, compliance program management, screening trades for conflicts of interest, tracking and approving marketing content, etc. Greenboard changes this by bringing all core compliance functionality onto a single platform (starting with the compliance needs of RIAs). See greenboard.io for more info.   The dynamics of the space remind us of HR/IT software pre-Rippling in a few ways:  A lot of fragmented functionality is needed on top of a core system of record. A lot of the needed functionality ultimately comes down to CRUD operations + collaborative tooling. Clear sets of power users exist (compliance teams for us, HR people at Rippling) but everyone in an organization needs a login Spend on software matters in non-revenue generating areas, and many organizations would love to consolidate vendors.  Humans, machines, and the future of financial compliance A super reductive checklist on how to maintain financial compliance looks something like this:  Keep detailed records of dozens of things having to do with your business, employees, and customers Examine these records and look for bad (non-compliant) things that might be happening Address the bad things that you found and put processes in place to prevent these things from happening in the future  Currently, the technology adoption rate is high for 1) and low for 2) and 3). It wasn\u2019t always the case that financial firms could count on cheap hard drives and cloud computing to keep records. Not long ago when filing cabinets (and file rooms) were the norm recordkeeping required substantial resources. It turns out that computers are cheaper and better than humans at storing files by such a wide margin that there are no longer roles for file clerks in the economy. Our thesis is that GPU-powered computational statistics will similarly transform step 2) above. Ultimately machines, not humans, will prove to be meaningfully better at examining records for potential compliance issues so compliance people can make determinations on compliance risk and mitigation. Asks If you\u2019re a fintech or compliance leader we\u2019d love to hear from you. You can reach us at founders@greenboard.io. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Greenboard's AI-powered compliance platform presents a significant challenge in the Latin American market. While the need for efficient compliance solutions exists across all financial sectors, the market is fragmented, with varying levels of technological adoption and regulatory frameworks across different Hispanic countries.  Many smaller financial institutions might lack the resources or technological infrastructure to adopt a sophisticated AI-driven solution.  Cultural nuances regarding data privacy and security must be carefully considered, requiring localized adaptation of the platform and potentially slower adoption rates compared to more technologically advanced markets. The economic landscape also plays a crucial role; the cost of the solution and the return on investment need to be compelling for Latin American firms, potentially requiring tiered pricing or customized packages.  Successfully entering this market requires a phased approach, prioritizing countries with more robust digital infrastructure and a stronger regulatory push towards tech-enabled compliance.",

Striving towards a reality where all people are 100x more productive because of AI + coding.Sam ParkLune AI\u00a0\u00a0Josh Park, FounderHarvard dropout, currently building Lune AI, the platform that gives developers access to better LLMs for code generation and answers from up-to-date technical knowledge sources.Josh ParkLune AI\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesLune AI - Better LLMs for code and technical tasks    Hey everyone! We\u2019re Sam and Josh, and we\u2019re building a platform for better LLMs for code and technical tasks. TLDR: Lune AI is a platform to find and train Lunes, or expert LLMs on any technical topic for code. We outperform the accuracy of standalone foundational models by 37%. Here\u2019s a demo:   The Problem: LLMs hallucinate on material outside their training data, which often leads to inaccurate answers to technical questions related to code. Whether it\u2019s working with a new library, or the ever changing nature of software documentation, every developer has wasted time on hallucinated LLM outputs. Lune Web: On Lune Web, users can find a marketplace of community trained Lunes on hundreds of the most popular libraries and Github repositories for developers.\u00a0In a concept similar to OpenAI\u2019s GPT store, users that train popular Lunes receive monthly payouts in a revenue share program.  When interacting with Lunes on the web, users can also receive payouts for leaving feedback on Lune performance and contributing their own expertise to specific Lunes. This direct community driven feedback loop continuously improves the accuracy of our models.  Lune API: In addition to Lune Web, we offer API access to our proprietary automatic context switching model, Tycho as well as all public Lunes. Tycho is our context switching model that automatically determines the right Lunes to retrieve information from given a user query, in order to provide the most accurate answer.  Our API is hot swappable with OpenAI, which means our users can integrate Tycho into any IDE, tool, or client that supports OpenAI compatible APIs with a personal API key, such as Cursor, Continue, and other AI client SDKs.  Project keys with our API can be used to easily integrate backend applications and workflows where superior accuracy and minimized hallucinations for technical topics are necessary. For example, generating compliable, front-end code with context from various pip packages or libraries. About Us: We are brothers who have been working together our whole lives, starting out with Lego projects. We both dropped out of Harvard because we believed that there is a very near future where AI + Coding can lead to 10x better productivity for the world. We want to make that a reality.  Our Ask: If you code and you have experienced LLM hallucinations, hate reading through dense documentation and Github repos, give Lune AI a try! If you are building a product that uses LLMs for generating code or other technical tasks and want a hot-swappable, more accurate alternative, reach out to me at sam@lune.dev  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Lune AI faces a challenging but potentially rewarding path in the Latin American market.  The market size for developers and tech companies in LATAM is growing, presenting a significant opportunity. However, several factors need consideration.  Firstly, the target audience (developers) is relatively smaller compared to consumer-oriented markets. Secondly, internet penetration and access to reliable infrastructure vary widely across the region.  Economic factors also play a role; subscription models might require careful pricing strategies to cater to diverse income levels.  Culturally, emphasizing ease of use and integration with existing developer workflows will be crucial for adoption.  Successful implementation will depend on adapting the platform to Spanish and Portuguese, addressing potential language barriers in documentation and user interfaces, and building trust within the Latin American developer community. Building relationships with key players in the region's tech ecosystem will be vital for growth.",

In specialties like physical therapy, some clinicians just let the phone ring out if they\u2019re seeing a patient, resulting in unhappy patients and lost revenue. The Solution Our AI assistants handle any phone call that involves a repetitive task, so clinicians can focus on helping patients. We don\u2019t ask clinics to rip out any technology to use our agents. That means we integrate with fax machines, EHRs, and existing phone systems.

One customer uses HumanLayer to ship DevOps agents that manage complex and risky workflows like production deployments and database migrations.   We\u2019re building HumanLayer because we know that the future of AI Applications is not gonna be humans sitting at a chat interface, the future is \u201couter loop\u201d or \u201cheadless\u201d agents, and our partners are building AI apps that invert the typical interaction paradigm. Autonomous agents are calling humans, not the other way around.  AI Agents are poised to disrupt the $4.6tn global labor market, but in order to make agents reliable today, and train them to be fully autonomous tomorrow, solutions like HumanLayer are an inevitable part of the AI Agent stack.Latest NewsThe four startups from YC's Fall batch that enterprises should pay attention to | TechCrunchDec 07, 2024Jobs at HumanLayerView all jobs \u2192Founding EngineerSan Francisco, CA, US$150K1.50%3+ yearsApply NowHumanLayerFounded:2023Team Size:1Location:Group Partner:Dalton Caldwell\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersDexter Horthy, FounderBuilding HumanLayer | started coding at 17 at NASA JPL.

I worked on container orchestrators, helped teams like Hashicorp, DataStax, and H2O.ai deliver and ship their on-prem k8s products. Core improvements to developer experience for Replicated.  I stumbled on the Human-in-the-Loop-for-AI problem while building slack-based agents that managed SQL warehouses. In 3 weeks I pivoted to HumanLayer and launched an MVPDexter HorthyHumanLayer\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesHumanLayer - Human-in-the-loop for AI Agents and beyondHi \ud83d\udc4b I\u2019m Dex, and I\u2019m building HumanLayer. HumanLayer lets your software contact humans for feedback, input, and approvals. It\u2019s perfect for  Implementing manual approval steps for software- and human-driven workflows Oversight of autonomous AI agents Managing the transition between the two  HumanLayer has clients for Python and Typescript and lets you manage approvals across Slack, SMS, email, and other channels. For AI agents, HumanLayer is designed to work with any framework + LLM. You can try it today at humanlayer.dev. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sbN8rh_S5Q    Ever since I got hands-on with HumanLayer, I\u2019m asking my whole team to think more about Agentic AI workflows - I used to think agents were not worth the effort to get them to production-grade reliability, but now I'm stoked on what is possible when you bring humans into the loop \u2013 Vaibhav Gupta , Founder @ Boundary (YC W23)  Why HumanLayer Before HumanLayer, I was building autonomous AI agents. Our idea for an MVP was an agent that would coordinate with humans in Slack and could do basic cleanup, like dropping any Snowflake/SQL table that hadn\u2019t been queried in 90+ days. We had already built a platform to generate recommendations, but we wanted to push the limits of agent frameworks, we wanted the agent to be able to actually do the work, not just generate the recommendations. Of course, we weren\u2019t comfortable with an AI application running raw SQL unsupervised, especially if it had access to drop tables, so we wired in some basic human approval steps. From there, I realized that the most useful functions we can give to any software are also the most risky. This is especially true for non-deterministic systems driven by LLMs. I realized that anyone who wants to build agents that do meaningful things will need tools for approval and oversight. So, I started hacking on HumanLayer to enable teams to safely build high-impact agents and put them to work ambiently and autonomously in the background. Use Cases Whether you\u2019re hard-leaning into AI or not, HumanLayer helps you build impactful automation that you can ship with confidence because you have humans in the loop for the critical operations. Forget months of tuning or broken use cases on every iteration; build confidence incrementally as you observe and test your apps in production (safely!).  Internal Automations - review/approve outbound emails or automated infrastructure changes Dynamic Data Labeling - think RLHF driven by the experts in your company - Use collected human feedback for benchmarking human vs. AI performance and for fine-tuning AI agents Ship fast and iterate - Roll out advanced AI features to customers without needing to get to \u201cperfect.\u201d Human review guarantees nothing bad can happen without needing to spend months on evals, tuning, and prompt engineering. Then, iterate based on how your agents behave in production. Customer-facing control and visibility - help your customers build trust in automations by giving them hooks to approve/review your app\u2019s actions   Really enjoying playing with @humanlayer_dev - instead of the manual outreach grind, I just hang out in slack and give my agent feedback as it finds new leads \u2013 Tom Granot, founder, https://syntaxcinema.dev   Quick Example Integrate HumanLayer into your python or typescript app using a decorator or webhooks.  To let AI apps contact a human for natural language feedback/input, just pass the human_as_tool() function into an AI agent\u2019s tool set.  Team  I\u2019m Dex. I am obsessed with helping devs everywhere deliver safe + impactful AI agents. I spent the last 7 years at https://replicated.com where I helped great developer teams like DataStax and H2O.ai build and launch the kubernetes-native versions of their self-hosted products. I worked on container orchestrators, led product teams, and founded the GTM org. I can\u2019t wait to build the future of AI Agents with y\u2019all. Hear from the foundersHow did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)Before HumanLayer, we were building autonomous agents that lived in slack. Our idea for an MVP was an AI agent that would drop a Snowflake/SQL table if it hadn\u2019t been queried in 90+ days. Eventually it would create new optimized tables based on past user activity. We had built a platform to generate recommendations, but we wanted to push the limits of agent frameworks, we wanted the agent to be able to do the work, not just generate the recommendations.Of course, we weren\u2019t comfortable with an AI application running raw SQL unsupervised, especially if it had access to drop tables. We didn\u2019t have the time or the resources to spend the 3-6+ months to get it to the ~99.99% reliability we thought it would need in order for us to be comfortable shipping it to customers. So I put on my startup hat, did things that didn\u2019t scale, and wired up a tool-call interceptor to ping me in slack whenever a high-stakes thing was happening.This eventually evolved into a 3 step approval process where someone on our team would approve an action, then the buyer / head of data would approve the messaging being sent, then a message would get sent to a stakeholder or executive like> **Hey, we noticed you haven\u2019t used this table in 90 days - okay to drop it?**Zooming out, I realized that there is a lot of potential in systems that can coordinate human approvals across a team, because they can enable you to ship AI Agents that do really big, meaningful things, safely. The most useful functions we can give to an LLM are also the most risky. We can all imagine the value of an AI Database Administrator that constantly tunes and refactors our SQL database, but most teams wouldn't give an LLM access to run arbitrary SQL statements against a production database (heck, we mostly don't even let humans do that). That is:> Even with state-of-the-art agentic reasoning and prompt routing, LLMs are not sufficiently reliable to be given access to high-stakes functions without human oversight What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?Between require_approval and human_as_tool, HumanLayer is built to empower the next generation of AI agents - Autonomous Agents, but it's just one piece of that puzzle. To clarify \"next generation\", we can summarize briefly the history of LLM applications.* Gen 1: Chat - human-initiated question / response interface* Gen 2: Agentic Assistants - frameworks drive prompt routing, tool calling, chain of thought, and context window management to get much more reliability and functionality. Most workflows are initiated by humans in single-shot \"here's a task, go do it\" or rolling chat interfaces.* Gen 3: Autonomous Agents - no longer human initiated, agents will live in the \"outer loop\" driving toward their goals using various tools and functions. Human/Agent communication is Agent-initiated rather than human-initiated.There are a lot of other problems that I think need to be tackled in this space, including* Toolkits to enable AI Agents to track and self-manage their token spend, sleeping/pausing until a given time/event.* Toolkits to enable AI Agents to extend themselves with coding tools acquire new tools and sub-agents through tools registries* Orchestrators that are designed for Agents that run in the cloud and that can handle asynchronous tool calls. Providing a great developer experience for durable execution in the face of tool calls that require a human response, which ay take hours or days to complete. ",

Students and providers practice with our AI patients to build skills and get evaluated. The Problem: Healthcare Training and Evaluation Isn\u2019t Scalable Healthcare still relies on slow, expensive methods like role-playing, in-person evaluations, and one-on-one interviews. These outdated approaches not only create bottlenecks in education and hiring but also cost institutions hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in faculty time, actor fees, and administrative overhead. Scaling these processes is critical, but traditional methods make it nearly impossible. While governments and accrediting bodies are pushing to expand healthcare workforces by increasing the number of schools and seats, the real bottleneck lies in non-didactic training. Schools have figured out how to scale lectures and coursework online, but they can\u2019t scale the hands-on, interactive training required to meet competency-based accreditation standards like CACREP. Adding to the challenge, it is illegal to practice counseling without direct clinical supervision in the classroom or the proper licenses. Students can\u2019t even practice these conversations with friends or family legally, which leaves schools dependent on expensive, resource-intensive methods like faculty supervised role-playing. The Solution: AI-Simulated Conversations at Scale Soma Lab uses AI to create realistic, interactive conversations with patients that allow students and professionals to practice and be evaluated anytime, anywhere. Our simulations replace costly methods with scalable alternatives, saving institutions significant time and money. Our system provides a legal, scalable solution for hands-on training, enabling schools to bypass these restrictions, meet accreditation requirements, and expand rapidly without sacrificing quality. Therapy programs use Soma Lab to train students with AI patients, reducing reliance on actors. Companies use AI patients to assess job applicants and onboard new hires efficiently. Medical and social work programs prepare learners for real-world challenges without the need for resource-heavy manual evaluations. In just 3 weeks, we were able to close 30 pilots with institutions like the University of Pennsylvania, Virginia Tech, University of Sydney, John Carroll University, and Western Carolina University.  For example:  Therapy and counseling schools use Soma Lab to replace role-playing exercises with our AI patients that simulate realistic therapy sessions. Students can practice conversations anytime and get evaluated instantly, helping programs scale without relying on limited and expensive faculty or actors. Teletherapy companies use Soma Lab to screen job applicants by testing their skills with AI patients, ensuring quality candidates are hired faster and cost-effectively. They also use Soma Lab for internal training to ensure company standards. Social work programs use Soma Lab to train students with AI families and patients, evaluate them on critical interactions, and provide targeted remediation when needed. Medical schools use Soma Lab to teach students how to handle patient interactions before they see real patients.  The Team We met at the University of Chicago after joining the same fraternity. Vrishank failed a clinical communications test and couldn\u2019t afford the $9,000 tutor fee. So instead, we built an AI clinical communications coach. Vrishank's score shot up, so we said screw it and launched the tool. In 3 weeks, we hit $5k MRR and 2.5k users. Seeing the impact this would have if applied to all of healthcare, we decided to build the AI infrastructure for healthcare training and evaluation. While in high school, Vrishank created a healthcare education app, which scaled to 120,000+ downloads in 6 months. Tigran was the lead machine learning researcher in a bioinformatics lab at the Luddy School of Informatics.

The need for scalable and affordable healthcare training is significant, particularly given the region's diverse healthcare systems and resource constraints.  However, several factors need careful consideration. Market size varies greatly across countries; larger, more developed economies like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina offer larger potential markets compared to smaller nations.  Cultural nuances related to healthcare training and patient-provider interactions must be incorporated into the AI patient simulations.  Economic factors such as purchasing power and willingness to adopt new technologies will influence market penetration.

Today's email products try to help you go through your emails a little faster, but if you have to get through 1000 emails, those products doesn't do much for you.   The reality is, most of the emails you get don't require you to personally look at them. Friday completely eliminates the need to check those emails, and handles them all at once for you, immediately.   Friday is here to file away spam, sift through newsletters for important tidbits, text you important notifications, and reply to mundane emails, so that no matter how many thousands of emails are in your inbox, you'll just be left with the few emails that actually require your personal touch.  Getting this right is difficult, so everyone else settles with trying to help you go through your email twice as fast.

Now, you only have to deal with the important, fun, or unique emails, forever eliminating the chore of going through your inbox. The Solution: Smart Inbox You can tell Friday the kinds of emails you get using natural language, and then define actions that Friday should take once those emails come in. For example:  When you get an investor email, Friday gives personalized answers to their questions and sends them a meeting link. If a customer has an urgent request, have Friday text you so you can respond to them immediately. Follow up with clients that take forever to answer their email, until they respond (they should use Friday). If you get customer support emails, Friday answers their questions based on its memories and forwards the interaction to your cofounder. Summarize all the notifications from GitHub, Linear, Google, etc., and then archive those emails Whenever you get a new customer, Friday can search the web and write a personalized email to all of them, answering any questions they may have, immediately And so much more!  Just take a look at your inbox, see the emails that aren\u2019t extremely important, and let Friday handle those emails from now on, so your inbox is left with the 5 emails a day that you want to personally handle. Personal Assistant Friday also lets you chat with your personal assistant. You can have it reply to emails, check your inbox, send out personalized outbound, and more! For example, if you wanted a meeting with Garry, you could ask Friday to go through your previous email history with Garry, perform a web search to learn more about Garry, and using what it knows about you, write a personalized email to him. You can give it a dozen names or emails, and it\u2019ll do research and write personalized emails to all of them that can be approved and sent out with a single message. Getting this right is difficult, so everyone else settles with trying to help you go through your email twice as fast. If you want to go 100x as fast, you shouldn't spend even a second on useless emails. Our Ask: This product is meant for anyone who would benefit from having an assistant manage their inbox. If you want to automate 99% of your emails, try Friday right now! Happy Friday!  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Friday's AI-powered email assistant presents a compelling opportunity in the Latin American market, but success hinges on careful adaptation.  The market size is significant, considering the growing adoption of technology and the increasing need for efficiency among professionals and businesses. However, cultural nuances must be considered.  Spanish-speaking users might need a more intuitive and possibly less technically advanced interface than what's initially offered.  Economic factors also play a role; pricing needs to be competitive and cater to different income levels.  Offering tiered subscription models could be a successful strategy.  Internet penetration and digital literacy vary across the region, potentially limiting reach in certain areas.  Initial focus on specific segments (e.g., entrepreneurs, small businesses) in countries with strong digital infrastructure (like Chile, Argentina, or Colombia) could be a viable approach before scaling to broader markets.",

It offers instant lead engagement and warm transfers to live agents. Vox increases lead conversion, streamlines pre-qualification, and integrates with your CRM while meeting regulatory standards. The Problem As interest rates change, demand for mortgages fluctuates dramatically. Mortgage lenders need to have a crystal ball to predict the exact timing of these moves and hire well ahead of a spike in demand. If that spike doesn\u2019t come, money is wasted hiring and training unneeded staff. If hiring is not done early enough, then revenue is left on the table when the mortgage lender cannot service the demand. The Solution At Marr Labs we just announced the launch of Vox Mortgage, an AI voice agent designed specifically for the mortgage industry. Vox enables mortgage lenders to contact borrowers in milliseconds, offering human-like interactions and rapid lead engagement. The AI voice agent\u2019s standout feature is its warm transfer capability, ensuring a smooth handoff from AI to live agents, increasing conversion rates and minimizing call abandonment. Vox Mortgage was created to address two crucial challenges in the mortgage industry: speed and seamless customer experience. Not only does Vox engage leads within milliseconds, but our warm transfer technology ensures a smooth transition to live agents, enhancing the borrower\u2019s experience and boosting conversion rates. Best of all, Vox Mortgage has unlimited scalability, allowing mortgage lenders to easily scale to make or receive as many calls a day as needed\u2013all with no fixed costs. Warm Transfers for Seamless Handoffs One of Vox\u2019s key features is its warm transfer capability, which enables a seamless handoff to live agents once a borrower is pre-qualified. This ensures that no leads are lost during transitions, maintaining a natural flow of conversation and maximizing conversion opportunities. Take a listen to a live Vox Mortgage call.\u00a0   Accelerating Lead Conversion in Mortgage Lending Vox connects with prospective borrowers in milliseconds, allowing lenders to be the first to reach leads after they submit online forms. This first-mover advantage significantly improves lead conversion rates, helping lenders stay ahead of the competition. Seamless Integration and Compliance Vox integrates effortlessly with lenders\u2019 existing CRMs, telephony, and loan origination systems. It can also be customized to meet industry compliance requirements, ensuring all communications are secure and meet regulatory standards. About Marr Labs Marr Labs is a pioneer in AI-driven voice solutions, offering human-like, scalable interactions for a variety of industries.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Marr Labs' AI-voice agents present a significant opportunity in the Latin American market, but require careful consideration.  The large and growing customer service sector across the region presents a substantial market. However, the success hinges on several factors.  Market penetration will depend on the level of technological adoption in each country, varying infrastructure quality, and digital literacy rates. Cultural nuances in communication styles must be incorporated into the AI's training data to ensure natural and effective interactions.  Economic factors, including pricing models tailored to varying purchasing power and the availability of affordable telephony infrastructure, are crucial.  Competition from existing call center solutions and the potential need for multilingual support (Spanish, Portuguese, etc.) must be factored in.

For the first time ever, sales and support teams can evaluate simulated and real customer interactions using the same automated system. Since launching this summer, we\u2019ve reduced onboarding times by 50% at several of the world\u2019s largest outsourced contact centres/BPOs and improved go-live CSAT at a leading crypto exchange by 3% (now above 90% CSAT). If you run a large support or sales team and care about conversation quality - we would love to speak with you! Demo Video:   The Problem: Sales and support teams struggle to consistently deliver high-quality customer interactions. Onboarding new hires takes too long, trainers and QA analysts spend excessive time manually reviewing only a small sample of conversation volume (3-5% at best), and skill gaps often go unaddressed until it\u2019s too late. Without full conversation coverage, real-time insights and tailored training, companies face reduced win rates, poor customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores, and inefficiencies that cost time and revenue. The Solution: Solidroad automates conversation training and quality scoring. Sales and support teams use Solidroad to\u00a0practice with AI customers\u00a0through phone, email, chat, and video calls. Each interaction gets scored and is provided with tailored coaching and feedback. The same scorecards can be applied to\u00a0real customer conversations, spotting where teams need to improve. Solidroad replaces manual role-playing and call/chat reviews by analyzing every single conversation\u2014both practice and real ones. By integrating with tools like Intercom, Zendesk, and Gong, Solidroad ensures teams are continually improving in both training environments and live customer interactions.  We help teams:  Reduce onboarding time for new hires with conversation training in a risk-free environment. Save trainer & QA time with automated, scalable coaching & feedback loops.

The problems and the opportunities we saw during that journey made us start Wuri.  The Problem Fiction readers worldwide are spending more time and money on visual stories, but the current selection isn\u2019t enough to satisfy their appetite.  Increasing demand: Webtoon is the largest visual story player with 80Mn+ global MAU, ~$1.7Bn annual revenue, 30%+ y-o-y growth But very limited selection vis-a-vis text stories: In the past 20 years, Webtoon creators have created about 1Mn titles, while on platforms like Wattpad (text web novels), more than 500Mn stories have been written in the same time frame.  Expanding the selection is difficult for existing platforms because even with the latest genAI tools, it takes about thirty man-days to create a one-hour-long visual story.

We\u2019re supplementing traditional numerical methods with machine learning models and a modern UX to enable engineers to iterate faster and build better products. Navier AI was founded by Cameron and Evan \u2014 former SpaceX rocket scientists with experience building software, hardware, and AI at the world\u2019s leading companies. \u274c\u00a0Problem: Engineering simulation software is broken  Complexity Overload:\u00a0Analysis tools are overly complex with an ancient UX, requiring years of experience to become proficient. Today\u2019s Engineers would\u00a0rather build and test a physical prototype\u00a0than simulate it. Simulations are too Slow:\u00a0The speed of design iterations is crucial for hardware companies, but even simulations frequently require HPC and take hours to run. Repeating mistakes:\u00a0Today's simulations don't capitalize on previous experiences. Every time an engineer runs a simulation on wing, they start from scratch, ignoring the wealth of data from thousands of similar past simulations.  \ud83d\udc65\u00a0Solution: Fast CFD, Modern UX Navier AI is making CFD 1000x faster with an ML-based solver so engineers can simulate fluid dynamics in real time. We train our model on high-quality simulation and experimental data, providing engineers the reliability needed to design and optimize the mission-critical parts faster. Our model, combined with a modern UX, enables engineers to produce engineering quality CFD results at\u00a01000x the speed for a fraction of the cost. This enables engineers to build better products faster by understanding performance earlier and performing analysis-in-the-loop optimizations. We\u2019re making fluid dynamics fast, easy, and accessible so that any engineer can iterate and optimize without being throttled by their software.  \ud83d\ude80\u00a0About Us: We\u2019ve built and launched land, sea, air and space vehicles Cameron and Evan are Aerospace Engineers, first joining forces nearly a decade ago to start a liquid rocket propulsion organization at UC San Diego.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Navier AI's technology, while groundbreaking, faces significant challenges in the Latin American market.  The target audience (aerospace and mechanical engineers) is relatively small compared to other sectors.  Furthermore, the high technical expertise required to use and understand CFD simulations limits market penetration.  Economic factors also play a crucial role; many Latin American companies, especially SMEs, may not have the budget for sophisticated software like Navier AI's, even with its speed advantages.  Cultural nuances regarding technology adoption and preference for established solutions should also be considered.  A successful entry strategy would involve focusing on specific niches within the region with a high concentration of aerospace or mechanical engineering expertise (e.g., Brazil, Mexico) and demonstrating clear ROI for potential clients.  A phased rollout targeting larger corporations first might be more viable than attempting widespread adoption immediately.",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.  We are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as: 1) Given my project\u2019s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase? 2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store? 3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?  Sage\u2019s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.  No group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren\u2019t going to cut it.   We have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called \u201cRAG\u201d (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.Storia AIFounded:2023Team Size:2Location:Millbrae, CAGroup Partner:David Lieb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersJulia Turc, FounderCofounder @ Storia & previously at Google Research.  10+ years in NLP.

We\u2019re Julia and Mihail, the team behind Storia. We have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called \u201cRAG\u201d (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep-learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa. \ud83d\udc4e The Problem: <5% of software teams use AI code understanding and generation systems Despite all the hype around AI coding following the release of GitHub Copilot, a disappointingly small percentage of engineering teams have actually adopted AI assistants into their developer workflows. Why? What developers don\u2019t like about systems today:  Code search is not accurate enough, slowing dev velocity. Code assistants are not grounded in their team\u2019s codebase, so they lack the necessary context to produce useful and high-quality answers. Code outputs can be incorrect due to hallucination which strains dev patience and trust.  \ud83d\ude80 The Solution: A contextual AI pair programmer built for any team\u2019s codebase  We\u2019re building Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, analyze, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:  For my project\u2019s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase? Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store? Does this codebase in our organization still work, and what steps are required for an integration with another library?  A few of the features Sage supports:  We index repos daily, providing users with the most up-to-date info about how to use a library (no stale, deprecated API definitions), We have a Perplexity-like focus on citing the source of every generated line of code, enhancing developer trust. We've developed algorithms grounded in research for syntactic and semantic understanding of a codebase so that we can provide more relevant context and use it effectively given a user query.  We are now actively working with seed to series C partner companies to help them integrate Sage into their developer workflows. \ud83c\udf05 The Opportunity: Making every engineer on a software team a 10x developer There are ~28M developers worldwide. Github Copilot is the frontrunner in AI assistant tooling and reached $100M ARR in 2 years, which is only a small percentage of the $913B spent on software development in 2023. \ud83d\ude4f Our Ask We\u2019re still onboarding a closed group of beta partners to integrate with Sage.

Hey all, we're building data centers in space. We\u2019re launching our first satellite next year, which will have the most powerful GPUs ever put in space by >100x. We will launch a larger iteration each year until we reach gigawatt scale. \u274cThe Problem Future hyperscale data centers will put a huge strain on electricity grids, freshwater distribution, and the Western world\u2019s permitting systems. It will simply not be possible to deploy multi-gigawatt scale data centers rapidly in the way we build data centers today. \u2728Our Solution We take advantage of falling launch costs to make use of inexpensive solar energy in space and low-cost passive radiative cooling, rapidly scaling up orbital data centers almost indefinitely without the physical or permitting constraints faced on Earth.

        "mvp": "Given the high technical complexity and limited Latin American market readiness, an MVP should initially focus on building awareness and establishing partnerships. This could involve: 1) Developing a detailed white paper in Spanish explaining the technology and its potential benefits for Latin American research institutions or large corporations; 2) Participating in relevant technology conferences and workshops in the region; 3) Securing pilot projects with universities or research centers with existing high-performance computing needs. A focus on demonstrating the viability of space-based computing for specific use cases in Latin America, perhaps relating to environmental monitoring or disaster response, may be more successful than targeting general-purpose AI training initially."

The Problem Companies are increasingly adopting LLMs to automate their workflows, but sufficiently accurate and consistent outputs are hard to obtain, especially in regulated industries where mistakes are costly. As a result, AI companies are using human reviewers in production to verify and correct the output of their AI pipelines.  This human review step quickly becomes a critical bottleneck for exponential growth:  Even if the output is accurate 95% of the time, there's no way to tell which 5% is wrong, so the human has to review all outputs. The cost of human review increases linearly with the pipeline throughput Even the best reviewers make mistakes, especially due to fatigue, when having to identify similar mistakes repeatedly. Domain-specific workflows require domain expert reviewers who are hard to find and expensive to hire.  Production-level quality control in regulated industries is an inherently different problem from model performance evaluation, since one cannot optimize the prompts to cover all the edge cases nor prevent all the unacceptable variations in LLM output. Our Solution Redouble AI is purpose-built to operate within these \u201chigh stakes, few data points\u201d areas. To address the problems above, our solution:  Dynamically learns from your unique domain-specific human feedback data. Provides recommendations on whether to send the output of your LLM pipeline to a human for review. Monitor the insights from your human reviewers at scale while also flagging suspicious reviews to ensure consistent final outputs. Integrate easily with your existing pipeline with just a couple of simple API calls.  In addition, we also surface succinct, actionable, and granular insights that can be used to further optimize your AI workflow. So you can continually improve your pipeline\u2019s performance as you scale. We understand that human-in-the-loop quality control is critical if you are working with AI in the legal, healthcare, insurance, or finance sectors. We are on a mission to ensure that AI can be safely used in these mission-critical spaces without breaking the bank.  Our Ask We are looking for companies that provide LLM-based services in regulated industries and use human reviewers. If you use human reviewers in your AI workflow, or if you know people who do, we would greatly appreciate any introductions and will offer any help that we can in return.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Redouble AI's human-in-the-loop solution for AI workflows in regulated industries presents a significant opportunity in Latin America, but with caveats.  The market size for AI adoption in regulated sectors like finance, healthcare, and insurance is growing, albeit slower than in more developed regions.  Cultural nuances need consideration;  acceptance of AI and trust in automated systems might be lower in some markets compared to others. Economic factors play a crucial role; affordability and the cost of human reviewers will impact adoption rates.  Successfully tailoring the solution requires localization (Spanish language support and documentation are essential), strong local partnerships to establish credibility and address specific regulatory landscapes in individual countries (e.g., Brazil vs. Colombia vs. Mexico).

On the flip side, primary care physicians know >40% of their patients need mental healthcare access - but these providers don\u2019t have the time or revenue incentives to solve this problem. They already have high daily patient quotas; making it impractical to track down the right therapist and coordinate care for each patient. The Solution: We take advantage of recent regulation changes that allow PCPs to get reimbursed for ensuring their patients get therapy. Our team handles the entire patient journey post-referral: scheduling; therapist-matching; telehealth visits; care-tracking, as well as insurer claim submission for both our therapists and the primary care practice. On the therapist side; we streamline the process of getting in-network with all major insurance companies; and unlock a vast source of referrals through our primary care partnerships. Team:  Jamie is a Princeton CS grad and an ex-Meta engineer who worked on plenty of user-facing growth projects. Zach is a Michigan and Cornell CS alum with experience integrating into insurance billing and building a medical supplies marketplace at Medly and Tomorrow Health.  Together, we\u2019ve interviewed and shadowed over 160 primary care physicians and psychotherapists.  \ud83d\udc4b How you can help Send this email/text to your primary care physician:  \u2018Hey Dr. [NAME], I know some folks building a startup that connects primary care with mental health.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Mango Health's model presents a significant opportunity in Latin America, where access to mental healthcare is severely limited.  The market size is substantial, given the widespread need for mental health services and the growing recognition of mental health's importance. However, several cultural and economic factors need careful consideration.  Firstly, healthcare systems vary widely across Latin American countries; navigating the regulatory landscape and insurance reimbursement systems in each target market will be crucial.  Secondly, building trust with both primary care physicians and therapists will be essential, requiring culturally sensitive marketing and outreach strategies.  Thirdly, the economic disparity across the region may influence pricing and accessibility.  A tiered pricing model or partnerships with NGOs could address this.  Finally, the prevalence of informal healthcare practices could present both a challenge and an opportunity; engaging community health workers could be beneficial.",

Initially, concentrate on a specific niche within mental health (e.g., anxiety or depression) and build partnerships with a small number of primary care physicians and therapists. The MVP should prioritize a seamless referral process, secure telehealth integration, and a simplified billing system.  Data gathering is key; track referral conversion rates, therapist satisfaction, and PCP engagement to iterate based on real-world feedback.  Pilot a freemium or low-cost model initially to increase user adoption and gather essential market insights before expanding."

We\u2019re Denzell and Nick, founder engineers of Trieve.  Trieve offers source-available all-in-one infrastructure for entire search teams. Engineers implement a pipeline that connects their data source to our backend then non-technical staff can fine-tune relevance using included frontends. Customers have the option to either (1) use the managed cloud version of the software suite or (2) buy a license to host it themselves in their own cloud or on-premise. We want to power every search bar on the internet. Problem - Poor search quality, lack of modularity, inaccessibility  Engineers first have to build APIs on top of DBs and AI models which then need to be maintained, scaled, and improved. Engineers then need to build UI's for tuning which then need to be maintained, scaled, and improved. Improving retrieval quality requires hiring more engineers such that you have enough bandwidth to both maintain and improve your custom and complex infrastructure. Ineffective spend of your search budget as you have to hire engineers to build and maintain things before you can even start adjusting retrieval quality.  Solution - Quality retrieval & source-available license Trieve provides a complete infrastructure suite that is both easy for a single engineer to integrate and allows businesses to hire more non-technical staff who can use the included front-end tools for fine-tuning relevance. With Trieve's solution, businesses can get more value out of their search budget whether it's $10k or $10M. WE have two asks!  Could you introduce us to developers and teams building search and relevancy into their products? Can you star our GitHub?

Background in Applied Maths with a focus on Biology and Machine Learning. I spent a couple of years at Palantir learning how to breakdown customer pain points and building software to solve them. Now I'm focusing on building AI purchasing agents for HealthcareThomas BlakeAstrix Health\u00a0Company LaunchesAstrix: AI purchasing agents for healthcare providersHi everyone, we are Abu and Tom, co-founders of Astrix Health TL;DR Astrix builds AI purchasing agents for healthcare providers. Our agents automatically purchase the right products at the right time, helping eliminate the $25 billion in wasted spend on medical supplies annually in the US. Why is this important? The US spends roughly $4.5 trillion per year on healthcare, with wasteful spending accounting for up to a quarter of that amount. On average, hospitals in the US waste at least $12 million each on medical supplies. Adding to the problem, nurses can spend anywhere between 20 minutes to one hour per shift searching for medical supplies. For clinics, this problem is even worse. Often, the same people responsible for treating patients are also in charge of purchasing supplies. They\u2019re already stretched on time to care for patients, let alone shop around for the best deals. While shadowing an imaging center, we observed a nurse doubling as an office manager, simultaneously managing inventory, searching for deals, placing orders, and treating patients. When we got home we started building.  Our solution Our product has three main functions:  Analyze: The agents comb through purchasing data (such as invoices) to identify high-spend areas and cost drivers. Search: Deployed AI agents search for better deals, considering provider-specific arrangements like preferred vendor discounts, GPO contracts, rebates, and other incentives. Purchase: Where appropriate, Astrix place orders when more cost-effective options are found, saving providers time and money.  In under three weeks, Astrix has started working with 10 healthcare clinics, identifying an average 20% cost savings across our first users\u2019 recurring supply purchases. Our AI agents deliver immediate value, reducing expenses and freeing up providers to focus on patient care.  Why now? Until recently, it was impossible to efficiently scan numerous websites and compare the myriad factors influencing purchasing decisions\u2014such as per-unit costs, availability, expiration dates, device sizes, shipping, and more\u2014at scale to find the best deals. Automating ERP and website navigation for purchases or negotiating with vendors was also previously unfeasible. Additionally, we're frustrated by the poor quality and outdated nature of the incumbent supply chain software and strongly believe providers deserve better. AI offers a unique opportunity to fundamentally rethink how healthcare professionals interact with computer systems. Moving forward Purchasing is just the beginning. We aim to become the comprehensive optimization layer for hospital supply chains, integrating inventory, purchasing, and patient data to put procurement operations on autopilot\u2014ultimately reducing that $25 billion waste to zero. Healthcare professionals should never feel stressed about ordering or obtaining medical supplies, nor should patient care be delayed due to supply chain inefficiencies. That\u2019s the problem we\u2019re committed to solving. The team Our team has extensive experience building AI/ML systems for major healthcare institutions. Abu and Tom, who met at Palantir, developed some of the first generative AI projects for the UK's National Health Service. Abu led Palantir's medical and pharmaceutical distribution vertical in the US and its healthcare generative AI team in the UK. Previously, he managed data projects at Duke Health and MedStar Health across clinical science projects and hospital operations. Tom has experience solving optimization problems with AI from his time as an Engineer at Palantir and his Maths degree from Oxford. Our ask Email us at founders@astrix.health. We're seeking introductions to:  Hospitals Private practices Ambulatory surgical centers  We'd be incredibly grateful for any connections. As a bonus, if they share their last month's purchasing data with us, we'll provide a detailed analysis of their potential cost and time savings. ",

While cost savings in medical supplies are universally appealing, the implementation requires careful consideration. Market size varies drastically across countries; larger economies like Brazil and Mexico offer a potentially lucrative market, but smaller nations might present limited scalability.  Cultural nuances in procurement processes and vendor relationships need assessment.  The level of digitalization within healthcare systems differs significantly across Latin America; some countries have advanced electronic health records, while others rely heavily on paper-based systems.  Economic factors also play a critical role; the willingness and ability of healthcare providers to invest in AI-driven solutions will vary based on budget constraints and technological infrastructure.  Data privacy regulations and cybersecurity concerns also need careful attention.",

It helps everyone in an organization write interactive documents to explain millions of lines of code in minutes instead of months.  WHO: We partner with chip manufacturing, enterprise IT, and software product development teams.  WHY: Traditionally, these teams spend millions and wait months (sometimes years) to understand their complex technology infrastructure well enough to build on top of it.   THE DRIVER DIFFERENCE: Instead, Driver AI is a tool that explains complex codebases in minutes vs. months. This enables teams to rapidly accelerate the technical discovery process and save significant resources.   HOW IT WORKS: Driver AI works by digesting a codebase, organizing it for analysis, and harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interactive explanations for executives, product and technology leaders, and developers.  \"Driver AI is a paradigm shift for managing our complex software delivery pipeline.\" - Executive Vice President, Global Semiconductor CompanyLatest NewsDriver launches an AI-powered platform for creating technical documentation | TechCrunchOct 08, 2024Driver AIFounded:2023Team Size:11Location:Group Partner:Tom Blomfield\u00a0Active FoundersAdam Tilton, FounderAdam was the co-founder of Aktive, an embedded machine learning development platform that he sold to Nike in 2019, and Rithmio, which he sold to Bosch Sensortec in 2017 (part of the the BHI260AP).

When you need to do technical discovery, you can use Driver AI\u2019s interactive documentation to understand complex codebases at a fraction of the time and cost.     \u2014 The Problem We Got Sick Of Hi everyone, we\u2019re Adam and Daniel. We\u2019ve spent our careers navigating complex codebases that had little to no documentation and, when it did, often written by engineers no longer with the company. Technical discovery has not only been maddening for us as engineers but also expensive and time-consuming for the business.  It costs teams roughly $500,000 and three months of discovery to unpack\u00a0one codebase. Multiply that by the number of applications in an organization and you're looking at years of discovery and millions of dollars. Companies can\u2019t invest that much into fully comprehending their existing technology stack, so they either abandon critical projects or the technical debt just keeps piling up.  How We\u2019re Fixing It Driver AI is a tool that uses LLMs to help teams quickly understand their business-critical systems. We use a simple three-step process:   Comprehend:\u00a0We ingest your existing codebases, organize them within our platform, and generate internal documentation at various levels of abstraction with LLMs. Our platform comprehends code regardless of language, age, or framework.    Explain:\u00a0Next, we provide interactive documentation that explains the capabilities of your codebases and how those capabilities are delivered. This documentation is written at the executive, business, and technical levels so anyone in the organization can understand it.    Accelerate Delivery:\u00a0Now that we\u2019ve slashed the technical discovery process from months to days, you can deliver projects more quickly. Fueled by the context we provide, you can also make better-informed decisions about what to do next, including giving these explanations to LLMs and asking them to do things for you.      Why This is Personal We\u2019ve been building companies and software at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning for over a decade. Our third co-founder, Jimmy, has led finance and operations for some of the most successful technology companies in the world, from large global leaders to high-growth start-ups. After selling his last company, Adam led various software efforts in innovation at Nike. But he kept encountering the same problem: Nothing new could be built without a long and very expensive tech discovery process. It was maddening.

Don\u2019t believe us? Try it free here. \u2014 Hey \ud83d\udc4b! It's Will and Nisal here. We\u2019re building Phonely, an AI receptionist system that ensures you\u2019ll never get put on hold again.  We are both former PhD AI researchers from the University of Melbourne, and 8 months ago, we set out to build an AI receptionist that could do everything that a person could do over the phone, and it's safe to say we\u2019re done just that. \u274c The Problem Missed calls cost businesses tens of thousands of dollars in lost revenue every year. Sure, you can hire a receptionist or outsource to a call center, but even they face the same problem. Humans sleep, have bad days, and ultimately don\u2019t scale. We can do it better, faster, and 70% cheaper than the status quo. \u2728 Our Solution Phonely uses a website URL to build a humanlike AI answering system in just a few minutes. Our platform then connects to scheduling software, routes calls, and integrates with an existing knowledge base, all while improving its responses over time.  After the call, Phonely provides powerful AI analytics and automatically extracts relevant information, sending it directly to the business CRM, phone, or inbox. Phonely doesn\u2019t just sound like a person. It can do things like a person, too.  Connect directly to your calendar to schedule, cancel, or rebook appointments \u2060Send SMS messages \u2060Trigger live automations based on the callers\u2019 inquiry Place outbound calls to remind customers about important events (i.e. upcoming appointments) And much more    \u2699\ufe0f How it works Phonely combines the best voice providers, language models, and transcription software to create contextually accurate, lifelike voice responses in under a second. If you give us your website, we will visit every page and extract relevant information automatically, formatting it to work with our custom-trained language models. We also directly integrate with a bunch of different software, such as Google Calendar and Zapier, to make it easy to manage appointments and so much more. See it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djG8ZJShquk   \ud83d\ude4f Asks  Build an AI receptionist from your business website (it's free and takes less than a minute). Do that here.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Phonely's AI-powered call center solution presents a compelling opportunity in the Latin American market, but success hinges on careful consideration of several factors.  The market size for call center services is significant across various industries, but penetration of AI solutions remains relatively low. This represents a large potential market but also a need for strong market education.  Cultural nuances are crucial; the solution must account for the diversity of languages and communication styles across the region.  Economic factors, including the varying levels of digital adoption and internet penetration, will influence implementation strategy and pricing.  Focus on smaller businesses in larger urban areas with better infrastructure presents a lower-risk entry point.  Furthermore, emphasizing the cost savings and efficiency gains compared to traditional call centers will resonate with business owners. A strong focus on Spanish-language support and integration with popular communication platforms in the region is vital.",

Core functionality should include answering FAQs, call routing, and basic appointment scheduling integration with Google Calendar.  A freemium model could allow businesses to test the platform with limited calls and features, converting to a paid plan for increased capacity and integrations.  Focus on gathering user feedback to iteratively improve the AI's understanding of regional accents and communication styles, refining the Spanish language model with locally relevant data."

In such cases, a physician is often appointed to conduct an Independent Medical Examination (IME) or, in certain jurisdictions, a Qualified Medical Examination (QME) to provide an objective assessment of the worker\u2019s condition. To make an informed evaluation, the examining physician must review the injured worker's medical records. These records can be extensive\u2014often comprising thousands of pages (we\u2019ve seen as high as 45,000 pages for one patient!). However, not all of this information is directly relevant to the physician\u2019s specialty or to the questions of the claim, so they spend hours sifting through the records to identify the most pertinent information.

So, physicians can see what is most meaningful for them without having to sift through thousands of pages of unimportant text. This saves physicians hours each day. Summaries are created and can be viewed side by side with the original records, so physicians can edit and type directly within the outputs (like a Google Doc) so they don\u2019t have to leave the page when writing notes or a report. PHYSICIANS AFTER USING BRIGHTERWAY  ______________________________________________________________________ How can you help? If you have any friends, family, or connections to somebody doing med-legal exams or IME/QME work (or wanting to start doing such work) either as a physician or a medical exam management company (a business that coordinates and manages medical evaluations for a group of physician examiners), send them our way! Hear from the foundersHow did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)Jason and Walker met at Yale University their first year. They realized their product could work when Walker broke his ankle, and while speaking with an orthopedic surgeon Walker told him what they were working on. The surgeon ended up sharing that he used to do workers comp cases and stopped because it was too time intensive, but that if he could use Brighterway\u2019s product he would like to start doing it again. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Brighterway's AI-powered medical record review system presents a significant opportunity in Latin America, but requires careful consideration.  The market size is substantial, given the increasing need for efficient medical evaluations across various legal contexts (workers' compensation, personal injury). However, several factors influence feasibility.  Firstly, market penetration depends on the adoption rate among medical professionals and legal entities.  Cultural nuances regarding digital adoption and trust in AI-driven solutions must be addressed through targeted marketing and education.  Economically, pricing models must be competitive and scalable to suit diverse healthcare systems across different Latin American countries.  The availability of high-quality training data in Spanish and Portuguese is crucial for effective AI model performance.  Finally, regulatory compliance within each country's healthcare and data privacy laws must be rigorously considered.",

We\u2019re Ruben and Alexis from Stacksync, here to help you forget about complex CRM APIs. \ud83d\udc4b **TL;DR ** Stacksync powers real-time and two-way sync between CRMs and databases. With two-way sync, we turn your database into a READ AND WRITE interface to your CRM data. From your database, make SQL queries to update data at any scale and your CRM will reflect these changes instantly. And vice-versa, when you update data in your CRM, your database is immediately updated. Try it yourself and get started here!  \ud83d\udca5 Problem Developers hate using CRM APIs. Their documentation is hard to navigate, with multiple edge cases and data inconsistencies have severe business consequences. This makes CRM integration complex, time consuming and costly. Worse, business teams working daily in CRMs are left with outdated or no data at all, while the data insights they need are just available in the database: it simply requires too much investment in development and maintenance. \u2705 Solution With two-way sync, we turn your database into a read+write interface to your CRM. So instead of reading and writing data from an API, just do it with SQL queries in the database that you already know and love. Whenever data is updated in your database, it instantly syncs to your CRM and vice-versa. Stacksync is different because it is the first tool that delivers consistent data you can trust in real-time. Stacksync just works. The setup is done in less than 5 minutes, without a single line of code.

His early success running a profitable web hosting business in high school showcases his technical acumen and entrepreneurial drive.Amir MehrZenbase AI\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesZenbase:\u00a0Continuous prompt optimization from DSPy core contributorsTL;DR: Zenbase helps developers focus on programming by automating prompt engineering and model selection. We\u2019re building developer tools and cloud infrastructure for teams to save time, never get stuck in prompt hell, and create AI apps that get smarter over time. Hey there! We're Cyrus & Amir. In the past, we've both been lead engineers and founding CTOs. We became contributors to DSPy and discovered the future of programming with language models. This is the story of how we came to this insight, our glimpse into the future, and 2 case studies on how Zenbase has helped companies escape prompt hell and scale prompt engineering.  Problem Prompt \u201cengineering\u201d is the most time-consuming, stressful, and uncertain part of programming with LLMs. With DSPy, we had found something profound. It promised to save us from the all-too familiar user journey we \u2014\u00a0like so many others \u2014\u00a0had experienced.  DSPy kept growing. It became Stanford NLP's #1 GitHub repo with 16K stars. We started hearing of folks in Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and 40+ other companies using DSPy to prototype apps with it. We began hearing the same things all over again. Although many found DSPy elegant and intuitive, countless folks found it impossible to grok. Those who managed to build something with it had headaches productionizing it; finding it difficult to scale, make reliable, and make performant. So, we set out to create the productionized DSPy. Solution  Zenbase lets you optimize your prompts and models. We offer:   zenbase/core is an open-source Python library that you can use to optimize your existing LLM pipelines using DSPy\u2019s optimizers (versus having to rewrite your pipelines in DSPy)   A hosted API for creating AI functions that get smarter with time. We ingest user feedback to continuously optimize the prompt and model. We use the latest tricks from DSPy, our own custom optimizers, and fine-tuning as appropriate to execute your intents in a way that's good, fast, and at a reasonable price.   An on-prem API for businesses with data privacy requirements.   Use Cases How Zenbase saved Vera from Prompt Hell  Zenbase came into the trenches with us to improve our evals from 10% to 80%. It really felt like they were a part of our team. \u2014\u00a0Taeib, Cofounder @ Vera-Health.ai (YC S24)  They were staying up until 3am on multiple nights trying to prompt engineer their RAG query generator to retrieve the correct documents. Their progress was uncertain. It was stressful. We call this prompt hell. Prompt engineering is the most uncertain, risky, and stressful part of programming with LLMs. There didn\u2019t seem to be a way out, but with Zenbase, they saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Zenbase makes prompting systematic and peaceful. We helped Vera go from demo to production, by optimizing the prompt of their query generator. With a product that could handle doctors\u2019 stress tests, they could focus on selling, and go to bed at a good time.  How Zenbase helped Superfilter create an AI that\u2019s personalized to its users  I\u2019ve seen a lot of AI Devtools and Zenbase is solving a problem that everyone building with AI will have when going to production. The best part is their product is so easy to use that it\u2019s a no brainer.  \u2014\u00a0Scott, CEO @ Superfilter.ai (YC S24)  It was all going great. Superfilter had just tested their AI email copilot with their beta users of investors and startup founders, and their users were excited. They onboarded a new cohort, and their prompts broke down. It worked well for the investors and startup founders, but not everyone. Scott and his cofounder Travis realized that prompt engineering wasn\u2019t going to scale to accurately categorize user emails into important, action required, or ignore.  Superfilter used our hosted API to create email categorizers that learned from users\u2019 existing behaviour. With automatic prompt engineering, they were able to scale personalized experiences for every user. Zenbase makes personalized AI apps easier to build and scale with automated prompt engineering.

How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)Cyrus and Amir have been working in startups as lead engineers and CTOs for 10+ years.Cyrus and Amir were introduced by a mutual friend 3 years ago. Worked on a handful of consulting projects together. Cyrus would sell, Amir would build. They were building AI apps and wondered, what if there were a way to use AI to write the prompt. Then, Cyrus discovered DSPy, the home of automated prompt engineering. He met up with its creator and took on a major role in the project. He persuaded Amir to join in. They became core contributors.Being startup guys at heart, they started exploring opportunities, and things just started clicking into place. What is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?AI systems are static prompts and models. AI systems need to be able to learn on the job. We build AI systems that can learn. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?Developers save time and effort: With Zenbase, they can ship high quality AI features in hours and not days.Users receive a better product: They can confidently delegate knowledge tasks with more because they have an AI that gets smarter and faster the more you teach it.Businesses drive quality and margins: The highest performing, most cost-effective prompt and model for the task are always used.

Music sample libraries are easy to use which has led to massive growth for companies who provide them (Splice, Output, etc), but they have a few key issues:  Professional music producers are often prohibited from using sample libraries due to copyright strike concerns. Amateur music producers feel a lack of authenticity when using sounds made by someone else and struggle to make meaningful changes to them.  Generative AI offers a unique opportunity to build music creation tools that are easy to use and offer fine-grained artistic control. Unfortunately, existing AI music platforms (Suno, Boomy, etc) offer very little customization and next to no ability to modify any generated output. \ud83c\udfb5 Our Solution Our team at Soundry AI has led the charge by launching the first-ever text-to-sample generator. Our proprietary foundational latent diffusion transformer offers state-of-the-art audio quality due to the efforts of our research team and partnerships with leaders in electronic music production. As you can see in the video below, musicians like Diandre can use our tool to create unique, high-quality, copyright-free samples perfect for their music projects.   This past week we released our newest product: Infinite Sample Packs. Now, all that a user needs to do is click a button to get accurate stylized sounds. Professionals have praised the quality and specificity of the sounds, and amateurs have been thrilled with the simplified interface. \ud83d\udce2 Call to Action If making music is your thing, we\u2019d love for you to try our sample generator here! We\u2019d be so thankful if you to share our product with all of your musical friends, and if you have any questions then please reach out via founders@soundry.ai. We can\u2019t wait to hear from you! ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Soundry AI's text-to-sample generator presents a compelling opportunity in the Latin American market, but requires careful consideration.  The market size for music producers and sound designers is significant, especially considering the vibrant music scene across various Hispanic countries. However,  economic factors, particularly varying levels of internet penetration and disposable income, need to be analyzed per country.  Cultural nuances in music preferences should inform the types of samples and styles offered.  A strong marketing strategy emphasizing the copyright-free aspect and ease of use will be crucial to overcome potential skepticism towards AI-generated music. The challenge lies in balancing high-quality audio output with accessibility for users with varying levels of technical proficiency. Successful implementation requires a localization strategy including language support and marketing materials tailored to each target market.",

The same happened when my cousin was diagnosed with a developmental disability. Today, there are 53 million Americans who take care of their aging, disabled, or sick loved ones at home. \ud83d\udea8The Problem: Last year, family caregivers in the US provided 36B hours of unpaid care ($600B) because:  The nurse shortage: right now, up to 70% of at-home nursing shifts are going unfulfilled. When these shifts go unfilled, family caregivers are left to fill in the gaps. In one state, 1 in 5 caregivers lost their job to take on the role of a full-time caregiver. Soaring in-home care costs: even if you can find a nurse, the average cost of professional in-home care exceeds $60,000 annually, placing it out of reach for 83% of families.  Most caregivers unknowingly qualify for government programs that compensate family caregivers, largely because the application process is confusing & filled with red tape. These programs are a patchwork of private and public insurance benefits with complicated eligibility requirements, glitchy websites, and long paper forms. In one case, I spent 3.5 hours on the phone to sign someone up, had to fax 30+ pages of eligibility forms, and then another hour on the phone to check if they were received. All before even starting the application. Plus, the office was only open during work hours, the phone line was only available in English, and the first agent I spoke to had never even heard of the program before. \ud83c\udf1f The Oma Way: We unlock a way for the 53 million caregivers to get paid up to $28/hour ($60,000/year) for doing what they are already doing. Oma Care offers free training and support to these caregivers, empowering them to deliver effective care. As a result, we unlock financial compensation for these family members through automated Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements. Some examples of things we do:  Automated eligibility verification & program enrollment: Our AI agent will call the government and spend hours on the phone so you don\u2019t have to. We also fill in those 30+ page forms and submit them on your behalf so no one has to learn how to use a fax machine like I did \ud83d\ude06. Educational training: 65% of patient care is done by family caregivers, and we help by training them with the medical skills and knowledge they need to care for their loved ones. Healthcare management: We prompt medication reminders, give them personalized care plans, and connect all their home health data to their provider. Technical Infrastructure: As a caregiver, you want to focus on giving your loved one care. We streamline financial and medical compliance so caregivers don\u2019t have to worry about payroll, liability insurance, workers comp, medical coding, billing, etc.  \u2705 And we\u2019re seeing buy-in from all parties: Caregivers are eager to finally get paid for the work that they are already doing. 77% of patients prefer to get their care at home from someone they know and trust. Payors & providers are excited by the idea of rewarding proactive health management to reduce costs (by up to 40%) and readmission rates (by up to 20%). And the government is making strides to support family caregivers, rolling out 350 federal programs and initiatives last year and counting. Plus, our software monitors the usage of these programs, making sure CMS dollars go a long way. \ud83c\udf31 The Big Vision We believe that the future of care is at home and we are building the technical infrastructure to achieve that vision. With a 47% increase in our aging population by 2050, the pressure is on to find a solution to support our caregivers - who provide 65% of patient care. Our early adopters - family caregivers - are our first stop.  \ud83c\udfe5 \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66 The Team We (Arianna and James) have frontline clinical experience (Medicine @ McGill) + health policy and family care experience (MPH @ Columbia) + Soft Eng experience from Amazon.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Oma Care's model, while successful in the US, faces significant challenges adapting to the Latin American market.  The key hurdle is the vast disparity in healthcare systems, social safety nets, and technological infrastructure across different Hispanic countries.  Market size is substantial, given the large aging populations and informal caregiving prevalent in many nations. However, cultural nuances regarding family caregiving, varying levels of digital literacy, and the complexities of navigating diverse national healthcare programs pose substantial risks.  Economic factors, including income levels and healthcare spending, will significantly influence adoption rates.  A successful adaptation requires meticulous country-specific analysis, focusing on identifying and tailoring services to the specific regulations and socioeconomic contexts of each target market.

Initial multilingual support might be limited to a subset of key dialects within the chosen country to minimize upfront development costs and increase accuracy.  This approach enables iterative improvement and adaptation based on real-world feedback, minimizing risk and maximizing learning before scaling."

We\u2019re longtime friends who met playing ultimate frisbee at Brown.  Charlie comes from Replicate, where he started the Hacker in Residence team and accidentally struck fear into the heart of Hollywood. Jackson comes from Netflix, where he built machine learning infrastructure that picks the artwork you see for your favorite shows. We\u2019ve used most of the AI coding tools out there, and often ended up copy-pasting code, juggling ten chats for the same task, or committing buggy code that comes back to bite us later. AI has already transformed how we code, but we know it can do a lot more. So we\u2019re building Melty, the first editor that\u2019s aware of what you\u2019re doing from the terminal to GitHub and collaborates with you to write production-ready code.

Hospitals have long lists of requirements and rules they must follow, leading administrators to spend hundreds of hours a month ensuring their departments adhere to guidelines.DocflowFounded:2024Team Size:2Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Nicolas Dessaigne\u00a0Active FoundersMichael Mounajjed, Founder, CEORice CS / Applied Math dropout now building automation software for hospital administrators at DocflowMichael MounajjedDocflow\u00a0Benjamin Liu, FounderEx-Rice CS, building software to help hospitals automate hundreds of hours of administrative tasksBenjamin LiuDocflow\u00a0Company LaunchesDocflow - Automated hospital scheduling and managementTL;DR: It\u2019s time for administrative software in hospitals to change Administrative tasks like scheduling and payroll consume extremely valuable time in hospital departments and clinics, diverting focus from patient care. Docflow automates these back-office operations with a customizable solution, saving healthcare administrators and providers\u2014including chief residents, doctors, and fellows\u2014hundreds of hours. This allows them to concentrate on what matters most: delivering exceptional patient care. The Problem: \"Wait, I thought I'd be saving lives\u2014not excel files?!\" Doctors spend almost 20% of their working hours (and plenty more in additional hours) doing administrative work. We saw this first-hand with our parents and siblings who are doctors that devoted their lives to help people only to spend a large percentage of their time in Excel. This inefficiency stems from a gap in healthcare software. While modern solutions heavily focus on hospital-patient interactions, they often neglect a connection just as important: the relation between the hospital to provider. Because of the dozens of rules and regulations, in addition to the lack of effective tools, providers are forced into doing complex back-office tasks that consume valuable time and energy. The Solution: https://youtu.be/MQqcWuxvdio   After initially starting at Harvard\u2019s Psychiatry Residency program, Docflow has been able to handle dozens complex rules, regulations, and program-specific information to safely create the most efficient program schedules. This centralized source of truth is vital for providing critical information to administrative tasks such as managing graduation requirements, processing payroll, ensuring compliance, and much more. By streamlining these processes, Docflow empowers programs to operate more efficiently and focus on what truly matters\u2014delivering incredible patient care. Here\u2019s some more \u2b07\ufe0f Customizable, Simple, and Intelligent Software: With AI, we\u2019re able to add a layer of customizability in administrative software not previously seen before. Now, when you want to factor in John, who loves working Friday shifts, or Mary who is on Maternity leave \u2014 or any of the various things your previous software just could not understand (by anything, we truly mean anything) \u2014 Docflow can do that with ease in just plain English.  Docflow is a simple solution for hospital\u2019s most complex problems.  Moving Forward: Although we initially focused on scheduling for residency programs, our main goal is to tackle as much complexity as possible in administrative work. We believe we can fundamentally transform extremely complex administrative tasks, allowing software to handle the work for you with ease. Our Team Michael and Ben met during their first few weeks at Rice University where they lived, built software, and studied applied mathematics and computer science together before deciding to drop out.  Michael - Michael grew up in Madison, WI\u2014the headquarters of the largest medical software company in the US\u2014born to two physician parents and grew up hearing about its shortcomings.

For example, an engineer could use our Python physics toolkit, which automatically optimizes physics computations for GPU computing, to test a new satellite control system in minutes instead of hours.  Hello everyone! We\u2019re Dan, Sascha, Andrei, Tom, and Akhil from Elodin. Drawing experience from roles at AstroForge, Google, Salesforce, Spatial, and several startups. We discovered that the rapid iteration in cloud software was missing in the field of aerospace, so we were compelled to make the development experience better.  Problem If you want to build an autonomous drone today, you've only got a few options when it comes to testing.  You can write your control system, flash it to your flight computer, launch the drone, and watch it crash over and over again. You can agonize over setting up a complex simulation using MATLAB, Gazebo, or something homegrown.  Those choices are time-consuming, complex, and costly. Now, imagine you are building a satellite or an eVTOL aircraft; you have no choice but to set up a complicated simulation.  Solution How does Elodin prevent this complexity? We don\u2019t; we just do it for you.  Congrats! You can now simulate your drone's control system easily, but that's not enough. What if a massive windstorm comes around? What if the neighborhood dog decides to take a bite out of one of the propellers? You need to test your control system for any situation you can imagine. Enter - Monte Carlo Testing Monte Carlo testing is when you run a simulation multiple times with randomized initial conditions. For example, you could run your simulation with randomized wind speeds. Elodin makes running Monte Carlo simulations seamless, through our cloud platform. We let you run 100,000s of simultaneous simulations right from the comfort of your laptop. Our dream is that you run a full Monte Carlo test of your control system every time you push code to GitHub. Historically, this would be very costly and difficult to achieve.  What Elodin is \ud83d\udc0d Python physics library - A toolkit for building custom physics engines using the GPU, imagine Tensorflow, but for Physics \ud83c\udfb2 Monte Carlo Cloud Runner - A cloud runner that enables you to run your simulation in a scalable Monte Carlo fashion \ud83c\udf0e 3D Viewer - \u00a0A live-reloading 3d viewer to share, inspect, and analyze your simulations  Try out our Alpha!

Our robots are different: they\u2019re easy to deploy, resilient to changing environments, and powered by AI that\u2019s trained with examples.  Hi everyone - we\u2019re Oliver, Chetan, Jon, and Max. After years of building and scaling manufacturing and robotics companies (Layer By Layer, S13, and Voodoo Manufacturing, W17), we\u2019re now focused on bringing automation to the industries that need it most.  We believe we\u2019re at a moment in history when robots can be made accessible and capable enough for mass adoption - and we need it more than ever.

The global market for airport baggage handling systems is $20+ billion and growing, presenting a significant opportunity for innovation and market disruption in this sector.  Passenger air traffic volume is increasing, driving demand for efficient and reliable baggage handling at airports and putting immense pressure on existing infrastructure. In 2023 alone, airports processed approximately 4.5 billion bags, highlighting the need for advanced solutions to manage this load effectively. Azalea Robotics provides state-of-the-art robotic systems that enhance efficiency, reduce mishandling, and improve passenger experience through more reliable operations.  Baggage handling is a critical component of airline ground operations, yet it is fraught with challenges. The work is physically demanding, often leading to long-term injuries among workers. Traditional baggage handling involves repetitive lifting and maneuvering of heavy loads, which can result in long-term health issues. Azalea Robotics addresses these challenges by automating the most strenuous tasks, thereby reducing the risk of injury and enhancing operational efficiency.Latest News13 companies from YC Demo Day 1 that are worth paying attention to | TechCrunchSep 25, 2024Jobs at Azalea Robotics CorporationView all jobs \u2192Founding Perception EngineerBerkeley, CA, US6+ yearsApply NowFounding Robotics EngineerBerkeley, CA, US6+ yearsApply NowFounding Systems Software EngineerBerkeley, CA, US6+ yearsApply NowAzalea Robotics CorporationFounded:2023Team Size:2Location:Berkeley, CAGroup Partner:Dalton Caldwell\u00a0Active FoundersJohn B.

StroudAzalea Robotics Corporation\u00a0Company LaunchesAzalea Robotics - Robots moving bags at airportsTL;DR - Azalea Robotics is building robots to handle baggage between touchpoints at airports. Our robots work around the clock, never get tired, and never lose or damage your bag after check-in. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SDPm09U6s&feature=youtu.be    The Team - David and John B. met in undergrad at the University of Georgia and have been close friends for 12 years. David has a PhD in Computer Science from USC and is an expert in soft-body robotic manipulation. John B. has an MBA from Kellogg and extensive experience in airline ground operations. They founded Azalea Robotics at the intersection of their combined strengths to modernize bag-handling systems at airports.   The Problem - Airport baggage handling is broken. It requires an immense amount of back-breaking labor, using decades-old infrastructure at airports, all while passengers increasingly choose to cram everything into a carry-on because they don\u2019t trust airlines to deliver their luggage on time and in one piece. Airlines and airports have an increasingly hard time hiring these workers and are plagued by frequent system outages and customer confusion and complaints during large weather events.  The Solution - Robotic systems work around the clock, never get tired and damage your bag, never misidentify bags, and are significantly cheaper to deploy than manual labor. Our technology allows large robotic arms to handle all bag types and intelligently improve with every bag transferred.  Our Customers - We sell our systems to airports and airlines around the world. Depending on the size of their airport presence (i.e., is this a hub for a given airline?), airlines will either outsource or hire in-house baggage handling for their customers. Airports are typically public entities run by the local city or metropolitan area and can be more or less hands-on with baggage handling, depending on their passenger volume. Worldwide, airports and airlines spend $20B+ to handle 4.5B+ bags (and growing) every year!  Our Ask - Everyone has a nightmare baggage story, and we\u2019d love to hear yours at mishandled@azalearobotics.com! Otherwise, if you're interested in learning more or have someone you think we should talk to, let us know at founders@azalearobotics.com!  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Automating airport baggage handling with robots presents a significant opportunity in Latin America, but with considerable challenges. The market size is substantial, given the growing air travel in the region. However, economic factors and infrastructure limitations must be considered.  Many Latin American airports, especially in smaller cities, might lack the necessary infrastructure (power, reliable internet, etc.) to support advanced robotic systems. Furthermore, the high initial investment cost could be a barrier for some airports. Cultural nuances also play a role; adapting the technology to handle the diverse baggage types and sizes common in Latin America is crucial.  Prioritizing partnerships with major airports or airline hubs in larger cities initially might be a more viable strategy than targeting smaller airports immediately. The success depends heavily on demonstrating a clear ROI and establishing robust partnerships.  A phased approach starting with a focus on a few key pilot projects could help to mitigate risks and build trust.",

This could involve automating a small section of the baggage handling process, such as a specific gate or a particular type of baggage (e.g., oversized luggage).  Collaborate with a major airport and airline in a large city with better infrastructure, initially selecting a smaller, controlled environment. This allows for testing and data collection to refine the robotic systems before full-scale deployment, demonstrating efficiency improvements and cost savings while minimizing initial investment and risk. The focus should be on demonstrating the technology's reliability and ability to adapt to local conditions before scaling up."

Also building a house in my free time.John PiottiSensei\u00a0Company Launches\ud83e\uddbe Sensei: Robotics training data, at scale.tl;dr: Sensei is the Scale AI for robotics training data. Our platform collects human demonstration data at a tenth of the cost and twice the speed of current approaches. Our Team We are MIT engineers who have been friends since undergrad. We worked together at Aurora Flight Sciences, where we ran a DARPA-funded program to develop AI algorithms for autonomous fighter jet combat. John went on to spearhead the reinforcement learning efforts at Aurora, while Anubhav returned to MIT for a PhD focused on robotics, control theory, and machine learning (but dropped out to found Sensei!). We have spent our careers working at the frontiers of robotics and AI. With Sensei, we plan to empower the expansion of those frontiers.  The Problem Data scarcity is one of the biggest challenges in developing robotic artificial intelligence. Innovators in the space are looking to apply the learnings from the Foundation Model Era: that large models trained on huge datasets are incredibly powerful. As researchers, engineers, and a rapidly growing number of commercial efforts race to develop large models for robotic intelligence, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that the availability of sufficient quantities of quality data is the most significant bottleneck. Current solutions are slow, expensive, and fundamentally not scalable. Human demonstrations are the gold standard for training data. Robotics companies currently employ fleets of 5-20 data-collectors. These in-person contractors teleoperate a robot to perform hundreds of demonstrations a day - with tasks ranging from clothes folding, to bin sorting, to dishwasher loading. This is not the right long-term solution:  Large-scale collection is prohibitively expensive: a teleop setup requires a physical robot, often with a cost of $40,000+ per operational platform. Low-quality data: restriction to labs/office spaces makes it hard to collect varied and realistic demonstrations Slow data collection rates: non-intuitive interfaces, cumbersome equipment, and faulty hardware lead to slow demonstrations on platforms that break often.   These drawbacks make it impossible to scale quality training data collection to the quantities needed for robotics. Our Solution We design and manufacture low-cost and easy-to-use devices for collecting human demonstration data. Our platform costs less than $300 and can be used by anyone to collect high-quality training data. As seen in a clothes folding task that demonstrates our research prototype, the operator is equipped with a sensorized exoskeleton arm that closely matches the natural human range of motion. The intuitive design, coupled with a suite of angle, vision, and inertial sensors, enables the rapid collection of highly accurate visuo-spatial state information.  Our main advantage is that an operator can easily set up and equip the platform, leading to an unprecedented ability to generate quality data at scale. Demonstrations can be performed for a broad range of common tasks, in a nearly infinite number of diverse settings, in as many different ways as human behavior is varied. In order to maximally utilize a fleet of our data-collect platforms, we are building out and operating a network of Senseis\u2014 contractors that have been trained to collect high-quality training data using our devices. Our Senseis receive task descriptions from robotics researchers and engineers, and are then paid to collect demonstrations that fulfill the request. Our combined hardware + software stack represents the first truly scalable solution to generating training data for AI robotics. Our Goal Within the next five years, we envision tens of thousands of operators, equipped with increasingly sophisticated, portable, and effective data-collection arms, exoskeletons, headwear, and tools. These Senseis will be located all over the world, come from and live in a variety of environments, and all have different takes on what it means to perform tasks \u201clike a human.\u201d This is the best way to power data collection for improved robots, and it is the future we\u2019re building. Ask If you\u2019re interested in solving the data scarcity problem in robotics - either for yourself, your company, or your customers - we\u2019d love to hear from you.

While the need for robotics training data is global, the market's maturity and infrastructure limitations present hurdles.  The high initial investment for robotics companies, even with Sensei's cost reduction, might limit adoption in regions with fewer established robotics firms.  Cultural nuances concerning data privacy and the gig economy need careful consideration. The success hinges on securing a reliable network of 'Senseis' (contractors) \u2013 a challenge given varying internet access and economic conditions across Latin American countries.

Before Preloop, he worked at Amazon where he scaled a data science team from 0-1, delivering 4 projects in the first year and leading the expansion of the team. He also worked as a senior MLE at EvolutionIQ, where he made significant improvements to a predictive model in his first month, helping them land a long term contract with Prudential.Tejas HosangadiPreloop\u00a0\u00a0Company Launches\u27bf Preloop - Deploy your ML models in hours instead of weeksTl;dr: Preloop automatically translates your ML training scripts into production services, handling the creation of the training pipeline and REST endpoints. This means that science teams can focus on developing new models while cutting deployment times from weeks to just a few hours (or less). We\u2019re building Vercel for model deployments. \u2014 Hey everyone, we\u2019re Tejas and Nikith and we\u2019re building Preloop. Tejas previously worked as a data scientist and software engineer at several companies, including Amazon and most recently EvolutionIQ, often leading 0-1 projects on newly established teams. Nikith has experience as a software engineer building multi-tenant distributed systems, most recently working at AWS on the networking team.  Our goal is to unshackle scientists from the repetitive tasks that accompany their model deployments and empower science teams to move faster. \ud83d\ude2b The problem Data scientists hate the work associated with deploying their models. Science teams spend anywhere from a couple of weeks to over two months deploying their models. Assuming that a team deploys 10 models a year and each model takes 2 weeks on average to deploy, this is 20 weeks of science time spent just on deployments. The biggest bottlenecks to quick deployment are a lack of easy-to-use tools and delays caused by handing off deployments to a separate team. \ud83e\ude84 Our solution Preloop automates the tedious and repetitive tasks associated with deploying and using your ML models, including creating the training pipeline and inference endpoints, autoscaling based on demand and retraining. We provide an easy-to-use CLI in addition to a dashboard to monitor and track your models. It works with major ML packages like xgboost, torch, and scikit-learn, with broader support on the roadmap.  \ud83d\udd0d How it works We scan through your existing script, identifying key information about the data, transformations, and the model being trained. This is used to construct both the training and data pipelines, as well as the inference endpoints that serve your model.  We also handle auto-scaling, observability, and versioning, so that you can train and deploy, but just as easily roll back unintended model changes. We have support for on-prem deployments for teams that have stronger security requirements. \ud83e\udd14 Why are we building this? As a data scientist, Tejas noticed that scientists (including himself) loved experimenting and building models but hated deploying them. More importantly, he witnessed that it often took multiple weeks before they were in production. There was a lack of a more automated solution to handle the deployment process, and even tools like Sagemaker require tons of boilerplate to work. We want to make it easier to deploy models, so that teams can move quicker, and scientists can focus more on science. \ud83d\ude4f Our ask  Intros to data science and ML managers at mid to large-size startups as well as large enterprises.

Sam received his B.A. in Computer Science from Dartmouth College in 2023.Sam CrombiePumpkin\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesActionbase: An SDK for automating popular sitesHey everyone! We are Sam and Adam building Actionbase. Actionbase builds tools that make the web agent-interpretable. Today, we are launching our first product, the Web Action SDK. TL;DR The Web Action SDK is a TypeScript / JavaScript SDK that lets developers run automations on popular websites with only a few lines of code. What\u2019s the problem? Web automations, particularly for high-traffic websites, suck to build and maintain. Yet engineering teams find themselves having to build them from scratch, over and over. Spinning your own automations is an easy path to unnecessarily complex codebases and enormous tech debt. Automations break down, hit edge cases, and become exponentially unruly. But this is business-critical functionality, so what else can you do? Solution: Web Action SDK We\u2019ve built an SDK that allows you to run automations on popular sites with only a few lines of code. Simply add your API key, define an action, and run it. Here\u2019s how you can use our SDK to send a LinkedIn message.  Initialize, send, and that\u2019s it! Now that you\u2019ve made your plans, you can use other services supported by the SDK to prepare for dinner: buy a notebook to take notes (Amazon), make a restaurant reservation (Resy), and get a ride to the restaurant (Uber).  In less than 10 lines of code, you\u2019ve planned a pretty cool night out. Value Proposition: Simplicity Web Action SDK does all the heavy-lifting for you: authentication, anti-botting, task creation and execution, self-healing, and hosting. Our goal is to enable engineering teams to focus on what to do with web actions, not how to make them work. Asks #1: If you currently have code that programmatically interacts with: LinkedIn, Facebook, Resy, Uber, DoorDash, Amazon, United, or any popular, high traffic sites, we\u2019d love for you to sign-up and try the SDK for yourself. If you want to discuss bringing Actionbase to your company/use case, book time here. #2: If you know someone who scrapes or automates sites, please forward them this URL or our email blurb. Our Background Adam and I met at Dartmouth where worked together on our senior thesis project. After graduation, we worked at Microsoft, building expertise in web automation and infrastructure on the Edge Copilot and PowerBI Copilot teams. We\u2019ve joined forces once again to make the web agent-interpretable with Actionbase.   ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Actionbase, an SDK for web automation, presents a niche market opportunity in Latin America. While the target audience (developers) is smaller than consumer-focused applications, the region's growing tech sector and increasing reliance on digital services create potential demand.  However, widespread adoption hinges on factors like developer community engagement,  effective marketing tailored to Spanish-speaking developers, and addressing potential infrastructure limitations (especially reliable internet access) in certain regions.  Cultural nuances are less significant, as the product is developer-focused and transcends language barriers to some extent.  Economic factors play a role, as pricing models need to be competitive and cater to different budgets within the development community.",

Instead of spending hours on tedious tasks, architects can 10x their design speed with simple AI prompts.  Brian and William met at Carnegie Mellon as engineers and separately had their own frustrating new construction experiences. Brian ran a tech-enabled homebuilding factory and found the design iteration process to be a massive bottleneck, while William built ground up homes in Texas and had a similar frustration. However, at the time, there wasn't an easy solution to the many pain points in the design process.  As AI reasoning models improve, Brian and William realized that there was a massive opportunity to fix the long-tail of frustrations and build a new construction design experience by fine tuning existing models, becoming bigger than Autodesk, the $60B company in the space.Jobs at ArchiLabsView all jobs \u2192Founding EngineerSan Francisco, CA, US$100K - $200K3+ yearsApply NowArchiLabsFounded:2024Team Size:2Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Nicolas Dessaigne\u00a0Active FoundersBrian Bakerman, FounderBrian is the co-founder & CEO of ArchiLabs.

We\u2019re Brian and William from ArchiLabs and we\u2019re building an AI copilot for architects! \u23e9 TL;DR  ArchiLabs is building an AI copilot for architects. Architectural drafting tools like Revit are clunky and difficult to quickly iterate in. With ArchiLabs\u2019 AI automation tool, architects can put requests into a chat bar and the AI is able to automatically run transaction-safe Python scripts to automate tedious tasks in CAD tools, making the collaboration process faster and more efficient. https://www.loom.com/share/aaa3f2c0362d4144b15663940ab512f2?sid=82aa3c09-943c-4836-aefa-4fefcc183296   \ud83d\ude29 The Problem Architects are talented, but the tools they use (like Revit) to draft homes and buildings are from the early 90s. The tools are clunky and slow to iterate in. This means that the iteration process is slowed down and leaves less time for filling in important construction details at the end. \ud83d\udc4c The Solution Many architectural drafting tools have powerful automation languages to get around the clunkiness of these drafting tools, but they are too time consuming to learn and use. ArchiLabs taps into this by creating a chat interface for architects to type in what they want to do in their CAD tool and have an AI write and execute a transaction-safe script in their CAD tool to automate any task they want. \ud83e\udd20 The Team + Backstory  William graduated with a degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon, then went on to work at Facebook. He realized his passion was the built world and set out to build homes from scratch in Texas where he experienced this frustration first hand. He then set out to build his own CAD tool. Brian graduated with a degree in ECE from Carnegie Mellon and went on to run a YC-backed tech-enabled homebuilding factory. He had a lot of frustrations with the architectural back-and-forth, primarily stemming from the limitations of existing tools. He then went on to build and sell an AI transcription startup. Brian and William met back up, sharing the same vision for reimaging the construction design experience and eventually taking on Autodesk, the $60B industry-leader. \ud83d\ude4f The Ask More beta testers!

Today, every new infrastructure project, from data centers to biomass power plants has a complicated mess of local, state, federal, and private sector standards that they must understand and comply with to make their projects profitable.  Offstream solves this by using LLMs to parse regulations, generate technical reports for customers, and manage 100,000+ operational data points on project\u2019s lifecycles. We cut the time customers spend on compliance by 90% and at 1/5th of the cost of alternatives.OffstreamFounded:2023Team Size:3Location:Group Partner:Diana Hu\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersVarsha Ramesh Walsh, FounderCEO and co-founder at Offstream.

We\u2019re automating carbon compliance for project developers. \ud83d\udc65\u00a0The Team  5 years ago, Varsha struggled through carbon compliance as a project developer at Indigo Ag. While she was at HBS, she spoke to hundreds of developers with the same challenges she faced, who all asked for a solution to their compliance bottleneck. Zach brings many years of full-stack software engineering experience at early-stage startups across compliance, legal, and accounting. He brings much-needed insight into building scalable products that replace people-intensive workflows. \u2757The Problem Despite a growing amount of funding (to the tune of $2T annually) flowing into new decarbonization projects, it is incredibly challenging for project developers to complete the paperwork needed to access that funding. Today, carbon project developers navigate a complex web of credits, regulations, and market standards. This information comes from local, state, and federal governments, NGOs, industry coalitions, and investors. Tracking and reporting on compliance data is time-consuming, opaque, and expensive. The standards are dense, and most teams manage millions of data points in Excel and emailed PDFs, creating admin headaches. \ud83c\udfc6\u00a0The Solution  Offstream is a one-stop shop for carbon compliance, making it simple for carbon project developers to get compliant and stay compliant with regulatory and voluntary market compliance standards. https://youtu.be/YrXj7POfO30   Users set up and generate life cycle assessments (LCA), which are a core component of all compliance standards.

While the need for streamlined carbon compliance exists across industries, the market's maturity and regulatory landscape vary widely across Hispanic countries.  Many nations lack comprehensive carbon regulations or robust reporting frameworks, reducing immediate demand for a sophisticated solution like Offstream.  Furthermore, the reliance on LLMs for regulatory parsing necessitates high-quality, readily accessible data on regulations \u2013 a resource often scarce in Latin America. The economic landscape also plays a role; smaller projects might lack the resources to invest in Offstream's services, while larger ones might have existing, established compliance processes.  Cultural factors such as trust in technology and the preference for personalized, relationship-driven services should also be considered when adapting the platform for this market.

Additionally, we generate insights based on all your alerts to give you a picture of your overall alert hygiene. The Problem Picture this: It's 3AM, and you're woken up by a page. It's an error you've seen before, and you know it wasn't worth waking up for. Anyone who's been on-call knows the infamous middle-of-the-night unactionable alert all too well. Even with modern tools, it's still tough to determine when something has actually gone wrong, the user impact, and how to fix it quickly. Why are existing solutions not cutting it?  Lack of context - it's really hard to understand the customer and business impact from looking at an alert. Alerts are noisy and not actionable. Debugging requires context switching between multiple siloed tools.  Our solution We're starting with our open source Slack bot that reduces alert noise. Once you add our bot to your Slack channel, we pull your alert history from Datadog. We analyze your alert history across various parameters:  Alert frequency How quickly have the alerts resolved in the past Alert priority Alert response history  Based on these, we classify your alert as actionable or noisy.  In addition, we generate a report on your team's overall alert health, pinpointing which noisy alerts are prime candidates for tuning or disabling.  Our vision is to stitch together all the relevant context engineers need to debug incidents in one place and automate root cause analysis. Team  We (Amaresh and Abhishek) have firsthand experience dealing with the challenges of on-call and alert fatigue at companies like Robinhood and Atlassian. With Opslane, we\u2019re reducing the alert fatigue that overwhelms on-call engineers and leads to millions in lost productivity and downtime.

We do this by running their Github Actions on high-performance gaming CPUs on a software stack optimized for CI. What problem are we solving? More engineers writing more tests over time leads to quadratic growth of a company\u2019s CI run time. On top of this, platforms like GitHub Actions have staggering markups while providing compute backed by decade-old server hardware. These platforms are disincentivized from investing in software optimizations to make CI faster since they bill by the minute. How is Blacksmith 2x faster? Blacksmith runs GitHub Actions on high-performance gaming CPUs. These machines offer significantly better single-core performance, ideal for tasks like code compilation, testing, and single-threaded runtimes like Node.js. The hardware is only part of the puzzle. Blacksmith runs a software stack optimized for CI.  We colocate warm caches with our GitHub Action runners resulting in 4x faster cache reads and writes Local NVMe-backed filesystem for highly performant disk reads and writes Docker layers caching across all builds in a GitHub repository resulting in faster docker builds (coming soon) Shared volumes to turn every CI run into an incremental build (coming soon)  The numbers speak for themselves  Here\u2019s Blacksmith being used in a public repo by one of our customers, Axelar.   How would I switch from Github to Blacksmith? All you need to do is install our GitHub app and change one line of code in your workflow file.

Currently, we're working on making it extremely easy for buildings to secure government subsidies to become more energy efficient, starting with New York. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AUIvrsmmE   Hi everyone, we\u2019re Isaac and Daniel! \ud83d\udc4b\u00a0We met two years ago while studying at MIT, and now we are solving the problem of building decarbonization at RetroFix AI. The Problem \ud83c\udf0d Building operations are the 4th largest global contributor to carbon emissions:  Globally, they are responsible for around 26% of all energy and process-related CO2e emissions In the US, that number is approximately 29% In dense cities like New York, DC, Boston, and Philadelphia, they account for over 2/3 of all GHG emissions  Our Mission \ud83d\ude80 We want to make it dead simple for every building in the world to decarbonize. We are committed to accelerating the adoption of clean energy technologies in buildings all around the world. We start by solving the largest barrier to decarbonization: money. Currently, we're working on making it extremely easy for buildings to secure government subsidies to become more energy efficient, starting with New York. \ud83c\udfe2 Why Start with New York? \ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f With the passing of NYC\u2019s Local Law 97, which penalizes building owners for exceeding emissions thresholds, around 12% of all buildings in NYC are starting to get fined this year for non-compliance. In 2024 alone, $20M in fines are estimated for these building owners. If no action is taken, the fines are expected to increase to over $85M per year by 2030, with over 70% of buildings being non-compliant. \ud83d\udcb8 These fines will continue to rise as emissions thresholds become more stringent over time. Consequently, investments to improve critical building infrastructure have grown substantially, along with the need for subsidies. Consolidated Edison (the largest utility in New York) alone has deployed over $2B in subsidies over the last 4 years! \ud83d\udca1\ud83c\udfe2 Contractors in NYC often spend hours researching the latest requirements and regulations to submit incentive applications, which are often not done correctly. As a result, a contractor may promise a certain amount of incentives to a customer but potentially deliver a completely different amount. This volatility in subsidy money is problematic for contractors who focus on delivering the best pricing and service to their clients. Because subsidy programs are often tied to government entities, contractors and building owners are interested in understanding how to \u201cstack\u201d incentives, but are deterred by the required reading to understand how to do so. \ud83d\udcda\u2757\ufe0f The Solution \u2705 We start tackling the money problem by streamlining subsidy applications for energy-efficient equipment for buildings. Contractors no longer need to spend hours emailing or calling incentive programs, wondering when they'll hear back or if they did anything wrong! By using AI to understand regulatory constraints, we accurately identify the best incentives and provide a comprehensive list of required documentation. \ud83d\udcdd More time and money back in our contractors' pockets! We constantly update our software to ensure the most up-to-date information, so users remain worry-free. \ud83d\ude0c Contractors can rest assured they are submitting the right paperwork to maximize their clients\u2019 incentives!

We\u2019ve been friends for quite a while, we met 3 years ago while Cami was finishing her MBA at HEC Paris and Nico was finishing his research at CMU, after that, we participated in more than 10 hackathons together, and made 450 sales calls to understand the biggest problems in banking and communications, we realized collections was a real issue. So we decided to start Domu.   At Domu, we\u2019ve built probably one of the biggest female teams in the current YC batch, and every day, we wake up with the conviction of helping our clients automate sales calls for collections and insurance sales. Our founding team would not be possible without the contributions of Margarita G\u00f3mez, our CTO, and Isabela Rodr\u00edguez, our CGO. As CGO, I have been able to drive the company\u2019s growth by 290% month over month, establishing new partnerships and showcasing our product. Margarita, as CTO, has made our voicebot more efficient, optimizing the automation process for our clients.  \ud83d\udea8 The Problem: Inefficient and costly customer interactions Very few people in the world like to make calls to charge people money.   Enterprises struggle with all the back-office tasks to manage call centers or debt collection agencies due to the volume of clients. Manual processes lead to high operational costs and a lack of scalability. Take our client, a major insurance company, as an example. They manually contact more than 150,000 customers monthly, which is around 500,000 minutes spent on calls\ud83d\ude31. This process also involves capturing data, pulling that data, and analyzing it, which usually results in suboptimal outcomes. \ud83e\udee1\u00a0The Solution: Automated and personalized communications at scale Domu automates customer interactions using GenAI, reducing the need for extensive operational teams. We automate calls and integrate with channels like SMS, WhatsApp, and emails, and give our customers real-time data to track metrics. \ud83d\udc9c\u00a0 By using Domu, companies can:  Significantly reduce operational costs. Improve debt collection and conversion rates. Gain real-time insights about their clients to improve communication.  \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc Click here to check our first DEMO   \ud83d\udcc8 Opportunity: The immense potential of our market For every large enterprise with thousands of clients, millions are spent on inefficient communication processes and sales agents. By automating these interactions, Domu can save companies substantial amounts and improve their customer relationships.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Domu's AI-powered debt collection solution presents a significant opportunity in the Latin American market, but requires careful adaptation.  The market size is substantial, with numerous banks and financial institutions across the region facing similar challenges with inefficient debt collection. However, cultural nuances regarding communication styles and debt sensitivity must be considered.  Economic factors, such as varying levels of digital adoption and infrastructure across different countries, need careful assessment.  Successful implementation depends on localizing the AI's communication style, ensuring compliance with regional regulations, and choosing a phased rollout targeting countries with higher digital penetration and robust financial infrastructure initially.  The availability of Spanish-speaking AI development talent should also be factored into the strategy.",

This MVP should: 1)  Adapt the AI to use Spanish and regional dialects, training the model on local data to understand cultural nuances in debt communication; 2)  Integrate with a local bank's existing CRM or communication systems via APIs; 3)  Focus on a specific type of debt (e.g., credit cards, personal loans) to limit initial development scope.  Success will be measured by the number of successful debt collection calls made and an increase in collection rates compared to traditional methods. The feedback gathered from the initial rollout will guide further development and localization efforts for expansion into other Latin American markets."

The founders worked at SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and NASA. The Ask\u00a0 If you or anyone you know are building spacecraft or any other products that could benefit from structural batteries, we should talk! Please reach out or send referrals our way to sales@govista.space or our website at https://govista.space. \u2014 Hey all, we\u2019re Vista Space, co-founded by Maxim Kraft, Petar Matejic, and Chaitanya Kore. Our mission is to power the next generation of space exploration. Problem Power is a fundamental constraint for space mission design, as everything operating in space requires electricity. Today's spacecraft power systems are not capable enough to support both the current and next-generation mission concepts, leading satellite manufacturers to painful trade-offs: limiting additional hardware or increasing system size to get more power.  With reduced capabilities, companies lose their technological advantage. With increased size, manufacturing costs are higher, risk of schedule delays is greater, and go-to-market is slower due to fewer spacecraft launches. These trade-offs are fundamental limitations of spacecraft design and space economics. While space-rated solar panels are thin, efficient, and can be foldable, batteries take up significant useful volume (up to 30% in small spacecraft) and are vastly less capable than the latest terrestrial equivalents. Solution Traditional spacecraft walls are purely structural, serving little functional purpose after launch while occupying valuable space. Our Voltaris 1 module replaces these walls, providing structural support and energy storage simultaneously. This allows satellite manufacturers to double their energy capacity without increasing size or gain 15-30% more useful volume at the same power budget.  Key Features:  Inspired by structural batteries in EVs like the Tesla Model Y and Cybertruck Plug and play with any chassis size, bolting onto the chassis in place of aluminum walls Compatible with third-party electrical & power system (EPS) modules inside CubeSat modules include a solar cell, and all form factors have the electrical components & thermal protection systems to work out of the box Additional radiation protection for the contents inside the chassis Launching to space in February 2025 Targeting pricing to be middle of the market for space batteries   About Us Maxim & Petar met at SpaceX, working on Starlink and Starship, respectively, and bonded over discussing opportunities for satellite design improvements.

We met while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles, where we built a $200 million specialty finance business line. At Alt, we faced the complex challenges that come with servicing consumer loans. We spent countless hours and resources developing internal tools to manage loan payments, communicate with borrowers, and keep track of loan performance\u2014all while ensuring a positive experience for our customers.  However, after dealing with the headaches of manual data entry, fragmented systems, delayed payments, lack of personalized borrower engagement, and the stress of maintaining accurate records, we knew there had to be a better way to service consumer loans.  So, we started Finosu to build the servicer we wish we had\u2014an AI-powered consumer loan servicer designed to streamline and enhance every aspect of the loan servicing process. Our mission is to transform loan servicing into a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experience. So, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.  Finsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with:  outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.  The operational cost of originating and servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business \u2013 we are changing that.FinosuFounded:2024Team Size:2Location:Group Partner:Surbhi Sarna\u00a0Active FoundersMark Ricciardi, FounderStarted in finance as a special situations private credit investor and then moved to tech to build productized credit instruments.Mark RicciardiFinosu\u00a0Gabriel Vincent Kho, FounderStanford grad.

While the need for improved manufacturing efficiency is universal, the target audience (developers and manufacturers of industrial robots) is relatively small in comparison to the broader consumer market.  Many Latin American factories, particularly in smaller or mid-sized businesses, may lack the technological infrastructure and resources to adopt a sophisticated platform like this.  Furthermore, the high technical complexity requires a skilled workforce which may be scarce in some regions.  Cultural nuances may also impact adoption, as some companies might prefer simpler, localized solutions or prioritize cost-effectiveness over advanced technology. Economic factors play a crucial role; the cost of the platform and associated implementation might be prohibitive for many companies in the region.

Hi everyone, we are Jesus & Gino, and we\u2019re building Kontigo \u2014A USDC-smart neobank for Latinos. (With a Bitcoin piggy bank).  The real problem:  The fundamental problem behind high fees, underbanked users, and failed currencies, both in Latam and the US, is precisely the same: the lack of a stable currency with global access and minimum government interference.  The consequence of the problem:  The U.S. is home to 65 million Latinos, representing the fastest-growing population in the country; despite this, 35% of them are underbanked. Each year, Latinos in the U.S. send over $170 billion to Latin America, often incurring fees as high as 20%. Once the money reaches Latam, recipients may incur additional fees of up to 10% to convert and cash out. In contrast, Latin America has a population of 700 million, with 20% of households relying on remittances for income and 75% of the population being underbanked. Latin America's financial fragmentation worsens the problem, with 33 countries using 39 different currencies.

Previously, I was a software engineer at nPlan, a startup focused on delivering AI solutions for large-scale construction projects with clients such as Shell, ExxonMobil, and Skanska. Drawing on my experience in construction tech, I\u2019m now building Karmen, an AI Assistant for Construction Project Managers.Naman WahiKarmen\u00a0Company LaunchesKarmen: The AI Assistant for Construction Project Managers TL;DR Karmen is an AI assistant for construction project managers, helping them save time by automating admin tasks like invoice approvals, RFI management, and change order tracking. By linking directly to emails and texts, Karmen captures and organizes project updates, letting owners and general contractors automate time-consuming documentation tasks. Project managers can save around 3 hours per day from searching through 100s of emails and uploading to multiple construction management tools such as Procore. The Problem: Project Managers Spend Hours on their Emails Construction project managers receive hundreds of emails daily, many from subcontractors. These emails often include:  Invoices: Billing for completed work or materials. RFIs (Requests for Information): Requests for clarification on project details or specifications. Change Orders: Requests for modifications that impact project scope, schedule, or cost.  Subcontractors often send emails or texts and are reluctant to adopt construction management software to submit these requests. As a result, project managers spend hours reading emails and entering data into platforms such as Procore. The Solution: Automate these Tedious Tasks with AI Karmen lets project managers link their emails and construction management software (e.g. Procore) to do the following:  Data Entry: Automating the manual process of entering details from correspondence, such as invoices. Project Matching: Match emails to the relevant project and subcontractor. Real-time Updates: Notify project managers of subcontractor updates that may affect the project schedule scope. i.e. a potential change order.

One even described their insurance claims process as a \u201cblack hole\u201d. Several factors contribute to this issue:  Growing usage of AI. Insurers are using sophisticated models to analyze claims and find ways to subtly underpay. Too many contracts: An average hospital has over 50 contracts with insurers with varying reimbursement rates for the same procedure, making payment accuracy verification costly and near impossible. M&A wave: Mergers are forcing providers to consolidate contracts and revenue tracking systems, adding further complexity.  As a result, providers spend months analyzing revenue and chasing payments, forfeiting up to 11% of topline revenue if they cannot afford the overhead to do so. With provider operating margins already negative since COVID-19, the situation creates severe margin compression and cash flow risk. Solution We use LLMs to extract data from the stacks of contracts that dictate provider payment terms from insurers. We reconcile the data against remittances to identify underpayments and auto-generate appeals.  Our mission is to level the playing field for providers with AI-powered contract analytics. Beyond this, we want to aid the transition towards Value-Based Care by powering sophisticated contract modeling as payment models become even more complex.

Our research suite leverages LLM\u2019s to help >8000 researchers discover, validate and curate scientific literature.  Mehul is a Materials Scientist and worked in Atom Probing R&D, Akhilesh is a national robotics champion and has experience as a Cloud Solutions Architect, and Ishaan studied AI and worked as a Data Engineer. \u2753 The Problem: Why does research take so long? Science is slow. Most research, whether academic or in industry, takes months or years to do. Researchers have to dig through 100s, if not 1000s of scientific papers during this process, and have to vet and extract key insights that are relevant to their project. As of now, a majority of the community depends on basic key-word search and manual skimming processes to do so - while wrestling paywalls. This can take anywhere from\u00a0weeks to years. \ud83d\udca1 The Solution: An AI-powered Research Suite We want to give researchers more time to do what's important. Lumina helps them cut the discovery and validation process down to minutes. https://youtu.be/uX-Y7_LcWhI?si=LwZ8JgcExuwcjz4V   Some key features are:  \ud83d\udcda Mini Lit-Reviews: Our answers find the most relevant sources for your query, and cite the key sections used from each journal article. \ud83d\udcca Tables: Extract key information from every source from the search - create a custom query, or use a preset to speed things up. \ud83e\udd16 Agents: Query multiple papers at once - connect our library and your collection for complex research tasks.  \ud83c\udf1f Vision: Speed up the entire scientific process We will be augmenting the entire scientific process with AI.

The market size for business intelligence tools is growing, particularly amongst larger companies and those embracing digital transformation. However, smaller businesses, which represent a significant portion of the Latin American economy, may lack the resources or technical expertise to adopt such a solution. Cultural nuances are important; user interfaces need to be intuitive and available in Spanish and Portuguese, and marketing materials should emphasize the solution's time-saving and decision-making benefits in a culturally relevant way. Economic factors, like fluctuating exchange rates and varying levels of internet access, must be factored into pricing and deployment strategies.

Design and front-end engineering is re-doing the same work twice. We think this is ridiculous, and a total waste of time for businesses that leads to a multitude of problems:  Engineers feel like they are wasting their time monotonously writing CSS to match pixels in Figma. They would prefer to focus on more interesting work that drives value - like business logic, architecture, and data. They also hate working with primitives and want useable components out-of-the-box. Designers feel that there\u2019s always a disconnect between what they made and production. They\u2019re constrained by engineering bottlenecks and their fixes will never be live. Many want a system they can put in place so the organization can be more structured and consistent. PMs & Founders hate having to prioritize design changes against product iterations and new feature releases. They wish that the design work could just get done.  \u26a1\u00a0Solution - The ion system ion serves a customizable design system & component library that can be synced with your codebase \u2728automatically\u2728.

Please describe your product and what it does or will do.Ion automatically converts Figma designs into clean react code to speed up front-end engineers. How it works: Ion plugs into existing engineering workflows through a VSCode extension and, given the context, learns from the codebase to write the best possible code. Ion also wraps existing design systems to generate modular pieces that are easy to modify and integrate. Ion enables designers to change designs that have already been implemented and automatically shoot out PRs to update the code. This removes significant engineering work and allows the engineers to review rather than write design fixes from scratch. We retain pre-existing changes to the code, so the design changes don\u2019t mess with written logic. Benefit to team: Engineers view design implementation as rote, monotonous work. So Ion automates that part and allows them to focus on the more interesting aspects that actually drive value - like business logic, front end architecture, and asynchronous data. ",

Every part of our core API was made to offer the most accurate extraction possible, and we now power document ingestion for leading AI teams ranging from startups to Fortune 10 enterprises.   We\u2019re excited to release a new Structured Extraction API, which leverages LLMs along with our vision models to extract the data that you need with exceptional accuracy and flexibility. \ud83d\udcc3 The Problem Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs and spreadsheets PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Hey Revia faces a significant opportunity in Latin America's healthcare sector, where administrative burdens are substantial.  However, successful implementation requires careful consideration. Market size varies greatly across countries; Brazil and Mexico offer the largest potential, but smaller markets might prove more manageable initially.  Cultural nuances regarding technology adoption and trust in AI need careful navigation.  Economic factors, including the affordability of the service for smaller clinics versus larger hospital systems, must be addressed through tiered pricing or partnerships.  Healthcare systems and regulations differ across countries, requiring localized adaptation and compliance efforts (e.g., HIPAA equivalent in each country).  The language support needs to be extensive, going beyond just Spanish to include Portuguese in Brazil and potentially other regional dialects.",

If you are a SaaS using (or migrating to) AWS/GCP/Azure for databases, schedule a meeting! \ud83d\udea9 Problem: As a SaaS grows, they follow these two trends:  They mature off 3rd party managed database platforms and move into their own cloud (onto an AWS/GCP/Azure) for cost, latency, and more control of their data. They move from a single shared database architecture to a multi-instance database architecture for performance, compliance, and due to data isolation requirements of enterprise.  These result in headaches for SaaS startups.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Fortress, a Postgres developer platform for globally distributed data, faces challenges in the Latin American market.  While large enterprises in major cities might benefit from its features (reduced latency, data sovereignty compliance), the target audience (developers and SaaS companies with global reach) is relatively small compared to other software markets.  Economic factors also play a role; many Latin American companies operate on tighter budgets and may prioritize cost-effective, readily available solutions over a specialized platform like Fortress.  Cultural nuances are less of a direct factor, as the product is technical, but the sales and marketing approach will need to account for varying levels of tech adoption and English proficiency across the region. Success would depend on focusing on larger companies in more developed Latin American markets initially, possibly partnering with existing cloud providers or system integrators to reach a wider audience.",

Empower non-technical business users to configure and maintain these flows with a no-code GUI. Problem: There\u2019s no good way for ops teams to build processes today Currently ops teams build processes in two ways, both with downsides  Tech teams build them in-house: can make sense for core workflows, but for rapidly evolving processes it slows everyone down when ops is dependent on software for all changes.

We automate data entry, requesting quotes, comparing quotes, and issuing purchase orders. Our customers save dozens of hours a week spent on repetitive manual tasks. \ud83d\udc6c Team We met five years ago while studying at the CDTM in Munich. Most recently, Berni worked as a full-stack engineer at Tesla on the Autopilot team, whilst Raban finished his engineering master\u2019s at Stanford.\u00a0At Tesla, Berni built tons of internal tooling and saw the supply chain inefficiencies firsthand. During the batch, Raban worked as a purchasing manager for one of our customers. \ud83c\udf0b Problem Supply chain data is spread across multiple platforms, such as ERPs, custom spreadsheets, and email inboxes, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of visibility. Supply Chain Managers spend hours each week searching through emails and spreadsheets to track the status of parts procurement, from request to quote to award. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and delays. For example, changes in production schedules require Supply Chain Managers to follow up with all suppliers individually to adjust their purchase orders.\u00a0Quotes that aren\u2019t used are lost in the abyss of email inboxes. Suppliers are reluctant to upload quotes to yet another portal and often fail to notify about delays, leading to costly production standstills. \ud83d\ude9b Solution  Soff connects suppliers, parts, and quotes into a single platform. We integrate with ERPs and email to automate supplier communication, send RFQs, and issue purchase orders. We turn unstructured email and PDFs into SQL-ready data, injecting quotes directly into the ERP system. We eliminate the need for manual data entry and dedicated supplier portals, thus increasing supplier response rates. Our platform stores quote data, ensuring no loss of information when switching suppliers or moving from single-source to dual-source. It also tracks parts from the initial request through to the final receipt, providing a complete overview for supplier management. Soff enables manufacturers to deliver higher-quality products faster.

        "description": "0News\u00a0https://www.shipoway.comRidesharing freight with ML to cut pallet shipping costs by 50%Oway is a rideshare freight platform that uses machine learning to automatically coordinate and sell unused space in trucks to SMBs at a 50% discount for lightning-fast shipping.   Every year, nearly 50% all truck space goes unused annually in the almost $1T US trucking industry. On the other hand, SMBs represent 44% of the US GDP and are historically forced to deal with high freight rates and friction due to their small size compared to enterprise businesses.   With trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and drivers alike.  Oway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business. Our ML rideshare protocol now allows businesses to ship freight affordably and faster than ever before. We also improve the survivability of independent truckers by maximizing their revenue when they\u2019re already on the road - and it\u2019s great for the environment too. \ud83c\udf43Latest News9 startups that stood out on YC Demo Day 2 | TechCrunchSep 26, 2024OwayFounded:2023Team Size:12Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Jared Friedman\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersPhillip Nadjafov, FounderFounder of Oway, an ML-based online rideshare platform that makes small-batch freight shipping affordable for everyone.   Self-taught engineer and occasional car designer.Phillip NadjafovOway\u00a0Company LaunchesOway: Ridesharing freight with ML to cut SMB shipping costs by 50%TL;DR - Oway is a marketplace that uses machine learning to make freight shipping extremely affordable for SMBs by automatically \u201cridesharing\u201d shipments using unused truck space going along the same route. We\u2019re popularizing a completely new way to affordably ship up to 8 pallets across long distances, cutting out warehousing transfers along the way. For example: You can now overnight ship up to 750 lbs of goods on a pallet, across the state, for just ~$60 (instead of $120 market rate).  Problem  Every year, almost half of all truck space goes unused in the $900B+ US trucking industry. Historically, freight shipping has been more expensive per unit for SMBs than for enterprise users due to their low relative volume. This results in higher COGs overall for SMBs, making it even harder for them to compete in their markets. On top of that, SMB freight shipping is generally an extremely low-visibility, high-friction environment due to its low value to a big trucking company\u2019s bottom-line.  Solution \ud83d\ude9a  We created an ML-based rideshare protocol that allows you to ship up to 8 pallets, overnight, for up to 50% off of market rate. When you place an order, Oway automatically matches and adds quick detours for independent truck drivers who are going to the same final destination as you with empty space. This saves you money and skips warehouse transfers (which reduces damage). Paperwork and communication is fully automated, and we use AI + LLMs to help with it. Oway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business. It\u2019s great for truckers. By doing 3 extra Oway deliveries per week, drivers can earn an additional $30K in extra income per year (avg. US trucker makes $65K in take-home income). It\u2019s also great for the environment. \ud83c\udf43  If you want to use Oway, we currently operate in California and are shipping to AZ, NV, and TX. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Oway's model, while innovative in the US market, faces significant challenges in Latin America.  The high concentration of smaller, family-owned businesses aligns well with Oway's target market of SMBs. However, several factors need consideration.  Firstly, the existing freight infrastructure in many Latin American countries is less developed than in the US, impacting the reliability and efficiency of the rideshare model. Secondly, the level of technology adoption among SMBs varies greatly across the region; digital literacy and trust in online platforms may be lower in certain areas. Thirdly, economic factors such as fluctuating fuel prices and potentially less efficient logistics networks could affect profitability and operational costs.  Cultural nuances related to trust and contract enforcement also need careful consideration.

I studied Computer Science at Stanford. Previously, I've worked at AWS and as a machine learning researcher at Stanford.Sherry LiuTamarind Bio\u00a0Company LaunchesTamarind Bio: API for scalable bioinformaticsTL;DR In addition to our no-code web platform (https://www.tamarind.bio/), Tamarind Bio now offers an API for computational teams to use cutting-edge bioinformatics tools for drug discovery without setting up any computing infrastructure or scaling up GPUs. We provide protein structure prediction (e.g. AlphaFold), protein design(RFdiffusion), and molecular docking tools at large scale and easily integrated into your workflow. Additionally, we deploy your custom models for internal use, provide virtual screening services, and provide pipelines to feed the results of models as input to the next downstream tool. The Problem Computational biology thrives on doing in silico experiments at large scales. However, it\u2019s tedious to allocate tens/hundreds of GPUs for compute-heavy machine learning tools, make sure they are running as intended, and analyze disparate results. Whether it\u2019s AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, RFdiffusion for binder design or DiffDock for small molecule docking, deploying these tools scalably and connecting them to downstream pipelines steals time away from developing models and doing better science. The Solution Tamarind is launching an API for state-of-the-art computational tools in protein design, structure prediction, and docking. Simply submit your job and check back to receive your result. Download these results, keep them in S3, or generate an analysis. Tamarind now integrates seamlessly with existing computational workflows: we\u2019ll work with you to deploy your custom models and pipelines or run on your existing cloud computing infrastructure.  We are Deniz and Sherry! We met as undergrads at Stanford, where we studied Computer Science and conducted comp bio research, experiencing the inefficiencies of using bioinformatics tools firsthand.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Tamarind's platform presents a significant challenge in the Latin American market.  While the need for advanced computational biology tools exists in research institutions and larger pharmaceutical companies, the market size is considerably smaller than in North America or Europe.  The high technical expertise required to utilize the platform limits its accessibility.  Economic factors also play a crucial role; the cost of subscriptions might be prohibitive for many Latin American institutions with limited research budgets.  Cultural nuances are less of a direct factor, but effective marketing would require targeting key researchers and institutions directly, emphasizing the time-saving and efficiency benefits over purely technological aspects.  Language support in Spanish and Portuguese would be crucial for wider adoption.",

These tasks were hard to automate with traditional automation tools because they required some degree of human reasoning. LLMs exposed reasoning via an API, so AgentHub was created as an AI-first platform that doesn't aim to simply streamline an employee's workflow, but can completely replace it end-to-end. The flexibility of our automation builder allows for extremely complex workflows to be automated. If Zapier were a calculator, we would be WolframAlpha.  How We Started \ud83c\udf31 AgentHub started as a UI wrapper for Auto-GPT. We quickly realized that people were using the platform to try and automate incredibly niche/complex tasks but autonomous agents were simply too unreliable and expensive. Our key insight was that when automating these types of workflows, you really want to minimize the use of AI, and keep it to just the core reasoning component of the workflow. AgentHub automations are generally 90% infrastructure and 10% AI resulting in increased consistency and reliability, while being economically efficient at scale.

Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes.   Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can\u2019t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.  While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves.   To change that, we\u2019re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes.  We\u2019re world class microbial engineers. We met while doing our PhDs in synthetic biology, where we spent our time applying and developing the most advanced bioengineering technologies to engineer living cells.1849 bioFounded:2024Team Size:3Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Surbhi Sarna\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersJai Padmakumar, FounderCo-founder and CEO of 1849 bio.

I studied Microbiology and Applied Math at the University of Washington before doing my PhD at MIT in a synthetic biology lab.

I studied chemical engineering at KAIST and did my PhD at MIT in the Department of Biological Engineering. During my PhD, I developed core technology used in the world's first engineered probiotic that went into clinical trial. After completing PhD, I worked in deep biotech companies, developing microbial products that were administered to over 6M acres of farmland in the US (about the area of Belgium!).Yongjin Park1849 bio\u00a0Company Launches1849 bio: Microbes for minersTL;DR \u2013 We\u2019re building microbes for metal extraction, enabling cleaner and cheaper mining of difficult-to-process ores. This will unlock 100M tonnes of copper stranded in ores that are not profitable to mine. \u2014 Hey all! We\u2019re Yongjin and Jai, co-founders of 1849 bio, a team of genetic engineers developing microbes for metal extraction. We met while doing our PhDs at MIT and have spent the better portion of our adult lives hacking living organisms to do cool/useful tasks.  Now, we\u2019re on a mission to make the mining industry more sustainable and ensure a stable metal supply for the green energy transition. The Challenge: The drive to electrify the world is driving an unprecedented demand for metals like copper, nickel, lithium, and other rare earths.\u00a0Unfortunately, ramping up metal production is incredibly difficult. Copper is expected to face a ~20% supply gap by 2031, threatening to slow the rollout of critical technologies like EVs and wind turbines. New mines are difficult to open, taking an average of 16.5 years in the US after a new ore body has been identified. These bodies of metal themselves have become more difficult to identify. After decades of selective mining, most copper today exists in low grade ores (ore that contains very little copper), making economical extraction with conventional methods impossible. Approximately 100M tonnes of copper is trapped in stockpiles and waste materials without any means to profitably extract the metal. The Solution: Biology! It turns out the mining industry is one of the largest-scale users of biotech in the world. ~1.2% of copper production in 2019-2020 was done using microbes in a process called \u201cbioleaching.\u201d The basic idea here is to:   Stack ore into a giant pile \u2014 think miles long and 100s of feet tall. This pile is called a \u201cheap.\u201d    Grow a very unique group of organisms that love acid and use both iron\u00a0in the rocks and CO2 from the air as food sources. This triggers a series of chemical reactions that ultimately separates the solid copper from the ore into a liquid form.   Collect this liquid at the bottom and run a current through it.   Then you have pure copper! Miners have been using this process for copper extraction for decades (and in some cases, for other metals like gold, nickel, and cobalt). The process is cleaner and ~7x cheaper than conventional processes. It also produces fewer tailings (mine waste), a growing environmental problem and liability for miners Why isn\u2019t this used everywhere?  It doesn\u2019t work for 80% of copper ores. Owing to some complex chemistry, the dominant copper ore, chalcopyrite, can\u2019t be processed using bioleaching. It\u2019s really slow, narrowing its use cases. While a conventional process can melt ore down and give you pure copper in an hour, bioleaching operates on a timescale of months to years.  We\u2019re using our deep background in bioengineering to build platforms and tools specifically for the types of biology miners need. By engineering the microbes themselves, we are introducing a new set of capabilities to the mining industry:  Bioleaching solutions that work on difficult-to-process ores, like chalcopyrite, unlock billions of dollars of value currently trapped in uneconomical materials. Faster metal extraction timelines, getting miners their cash faster. Low CapEx, sustainable metal extraction. Our solutions fit into existing mine infrastructure and processes.  Our asks:  If you know anyone in the mining industry, we\u2019d love to meet them! If you know anyone working in the e-waste recycling industry, we\u2019d love to chat with them, too. We can tune our process for e-waste recycling and are looking into applications for that as well.  Reach out to intro@1849.bio! ",

As carriers struggle to hire, existing talent is getting overloaded and under-trained, causing severe retention issues at most large carriers. This talent squeeze means that per-case performance quality drops, leading claimants to experience confusion and frustration, which inevitably drives litigation rates upwards as they seek representation and support. As a result, average claim costs are rising, squeezing carriers expense ratios at the same time as inflation causes ballooning medical costs. Still, claims adjusters like my sister spend most of their day transcribing telephone calls, navigating large sets of semi-structured policies, and mapping data from large and complicated medical documents to relatively structured schemas in their existing CMS. \ud83e\uddbe Our Solution At InQuery, our mission is to develop AI agents tailored for the insurance industry, beginning with with claims handling. These agents will enable claims handlers to concentrate on high-impact settlement strategies, effective negotiations, and casualty remediation processes. The result?

We let you watch, enrich, or search for any person or company on LinkedIn - and get updates in real-time. \ud83d\udea9 Problem Getting fresh, reliable, accurate B2B data at scale is hard. In 2024, data needs to be live and pinpoint accurate, but most data platforms source from unreliable, poorly maintained 3rd party sources. And the data isn\u2019t updated frequently \u2014 monthly, if you\u2019re lucky. Any company trying to add an intelligence layer to their system or process needs data. Problem: it\u2019s an incredible technology challenge to do that at scale. \u2705 Solution We have developed technology that allows us to index and pipe in live data from almost any data source. Currently, we do this at scale from sources including LinkedIn, the SEC, funding announcements and milestones, employee ratings, product reviews, web traffic -\u00a0 and deliver this data instantly to our customers. Our technology also enables you to \u2018watch\u2019 companies and people on a live basis. Get monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or instant updates when a predefined event happens. Events like: - Company grows or declines in headcount - Company grows in headcount by certain role - Company grows in certain headcount in specific regions - Company hires for specific technologies or titles in specific regions - Company lists a job posting for a certain title or technology - Company announces or closes funding round - Company gets a new product review - Person changes jobs - Person gets a promotion - Person adds a new skill - Company or Person makes a LinkedIn post \u25b6\ufe0f Demo https://youtu.be/TwUYDCrdLvk   \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f Why now Clean, fresh, and accurate data is becoming increasingly important. The age of AI is producing whole new product lines and allowing companies to make their sales process smart. There are AI SDR companies that are totally reliant on fresh, primary source data to run their whole process. B2B sales teams are depending on appropriate triggers to make sure they are reaching out to the right person at the right time. Customer success teams need to track key personnel at their customers, in real-time. Growth equity investors are shifting towards in-house data stacks and models to do their entire deal sourcing. Early stage startups need a data-driven approach in GTM research to identify the right market they can plant their wedge in. \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb Team We have a decade plus experience building our own separate VC-backed data products.

We're launching Automated AI voice agent testing to automatically test your voice agents and flag quality issues in development and production. \ud83c\udf1f Click here to try our free Voice Simulations Demo \ud83c\udf1f Problem: Making voice agents reliable feels like whack-a-mole Here's the workflow most teams follow:  Call your voice agent by hand and find bugs. Slow and ad-hoc. Tweak your voice agents by adding new tools and changing the prompts or models to fix the bugs. Call again to see if the changes worked. Detect regressions when users complain of things breaking in production. Repeat steps 1 to 4 until you get tired.  Calling your voice agent & finding bugs is the slowest & most painful part of the feedback loop. This is what we automate. Our take: Character AI for voice testing We create hundreds of characters that simulate how real users interact with your voice agents in real life. For every call, we measure whether our character successfully accomplishes the task (e.g., ordering a vegan burger, canceling next week\u2019s appointment, etc.). Our automated AI voice agent testing approach is 100x faster, cheaper, and more thorough than manual testing.  Flag errors & Tag calls in production You can log all call transcripts and traces within Hamming. We actively tag your production calls in real-time, and flag cases the team needs to double-click on. This helps engineering teams quickly prioritize cases they need to fix. Example tags: human detects that the bot is an AI, a follow-up call is needed, the user requested an urgent appointment, etc.  Test new changes quickly Simulation-driven development Let\u2019s imagine you\u2019re building an agent called \u2018YC Founder\u2019; we can spin up 100s of VC agents who will try to distract you. You can edit the prompts or models and re-run the simulation to make sure you made progress. Want to see how you would handle a persistent investor? Try our \u2018VC trying to distract founders\u2019 free demo here.  Easily create new characters from call transcripts When customers complain about a bad call, you can locate the call transcript and create a new character in one click.

Developers no longer need to manually write or re-write logs \u2014 Patchwork does it for them. Actionable, context-rich, secure logs can become the new standard across your entire codebase. The product currently works with Java, Go, Python, Ruby, TypeScript, JavaScript, Scala, and Kotlin. https://youtu.be/70Pnfu8HHHQ   The Problem with Logs Manually instrumenting code with logging is time-consuming and tedious. Unlike building features, logging doesn\u2019t earn promotions. Logs are written by developers but consumed by SREs and security engineers once in production. Picture this: a critical incident strikes at 2 AM. Your SREs are scrambling, frantically searching through a mess of inconsistent logs, trying to piece together what went wrong. Sound familiar? That\u2019s because logging, as it stands today, is broken. Empires like Splunk have been built on the premise that messy logs are a fact of life and you therefore need to fork out for best-in-class indexing and querying. We say it\u2019s time to tackle this problem at the source.  Patchwork: Logging, Un-imagined With Patchwork, developers can focus on building features while our product ensures that every log is context-rich, actionable, and secure. Developers can un-imagine logs, forever. Patchwork works in the background, reviewing your existing codebase and stepping in during continuous integration to ensure that your new code meets your engineering standards. Our product is flexible, but in our experience, good logs:  Are context-rich and actionable, Explain what the failed method was attempting (the intent), Provide the context in which it failed (the state of all relevant variables), Use a structured format, Handle sensitive information gracefully (never include tokens/passwords, label or exclude, e.g., personal information).  Our mission is to provide a few-click, automated journey to implement logging from code through to storage. Our Ask: Give an SRE a Hug And then, help them out by giving them our email \u2013 founders@getpatchwork.io. We\u2019d love to connect with Senior SREs and VPs of Engineering \u2013 in our experience, they really get it. Check out how we think at our blog.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Felafax's focus on non-NVIDIA GPU AI infrastructure presents a unique opportunity in Latin America. While the market for advanced AI solutions is still developing, the cost-effectiveness and performance improvements offered by Felafax could attract interest from businesses and research institutions.  However, the target audience is relatively niche (developers and data scientists), limiting immediate market size compared to consumer-facing applications.  Cultural nuances are less relevant given the technical nature of the product; the focus is on functionality and efficiency. Economic factors are important; the affordability of Felafax's solution compared to NVIDIA alternatives is a key selling point, particularly in regions with tighter budgets.  The challenge will be to clearly communicate the value proposition to a relatively sophisticated, but potentially smaller, target market.",

We\u2019re\u00a0Pascal\u00a0and\u00a0Ken, here to introduce you to\u00a0Basepilot. TL;DR: Basepilot creates AI assistants to automate repetitive and manual work across a browser. We help companies save 30% of their time weekly and cut costs, freeing up resources for more high-value tasks. For example, finance, recruitment, or sales teams can automate mundane back-office tasks within a few clicks and a quick demonstration.  Where Basepilot can help you:  Sales - To help automate sales outreach, prospecting, and follow-ups. Recruitment - To help with sourcing candidates and clients, and analyzing and triaging profiles. Finance - To help fill in applications/forms, transfer data, do accounting ops, and update customer details. & any other manual task across your browser!  Problem - 30% of a business\u2019s total time and resources is wasted on mundane repetitive work Currently, businesses employ teams of knowledge workers (in sales, ops, recruitment, finance, and more) that face a lot of manual and repetitive processes that slow them down. Although critical to get done, these tasks take hours away from doing more high-value work leading to frustration and lower output among teams. For a business, this results in:  30% of their team\u2019s time wasted on mindless tasks Wasted resources spent on hiring more people to handle the workload Increased error rates through manual boring work  For example, a recruitment firm spends 8+ hours/week per recruiter on repetitive admin work to source candidates, analyze applications and enter data, instead of talking to candidates!  Existing solutions suck!  Off-the-shelf tools often don\u2019t work as workflows are very specific to a company. Automating processes with tools like UI Path is extremely expensive, requires specialist automation engineers and takes several weeks or months to set up.

We aim to launch servicing stations in Low Earth Orbit in 2025 and expand to Geostationary Orbit, the Moon, and Mars by 2030. \"Helping space explorers go \"where no man has gone before\" - Captain James T. Kirk :) _ _ Hi, everyone. We are Ashi Dissanayake and Reza Fetanat, the team behind Spaceium.  Here's a brief introduction: Ashi is an Aerospace Engineer specializing in Orbital Mechanics and rocket propulsion. Ashi has worked on real-time simulation models for uncrewed return missions to asteroids and on NASA-related aerodynamics projects. Reza is also a space enthusiast and a Mechanical Engineer specializing in Robotics, structures, and Cryogenics. Reza has worked on revitalizing the LR-101 engine, which was used on Atlas, Thor, and Delta launch vehicles. We first met while leading the University of Ottawa's rocketry team, where we built high-powered rockets to send scientific payloads to different altitudes. In our spare time, we enjoyed working together to build rockets in the backyard, sometimes leading to interesting experiences with backyard fires. \ud83d\udd25 Throughout our careers, we've noticed the constraints on space missions due to the lack of ability to refuel or repair spacecraft in orbit. The current solutions are costly, and a centralized location where spacecraft can refuel and repair is a massive necessity. We are on a mission to build the missing piece of space infrastructure that connects the space superhighway, Just like how service stations were built on Earth back in the day! The problem All spacecraft and space missions face a standard set of challenges. Fuel is a limited and difficult resource to transport. In the event of a significant issue, spacecraft cannot be repaired in space. These challenges have significantly hindered efficiency in current space missions and have been a substantial obstacle in humanity's quest to explore space further. Unlike a road trip where refueling is common and convenient, spacecraft face a unique challenge. Spacecraft cannot refuel along the way. Instead, they must carry all the fuel required for the mission from Earth. An overwhelming 85% - 95% of the launch weight is fuel on a typical launch vehicle, with 80-90% burned off to reach orbit. \ud83d\ude80 As a result, spacecraft that transport loads in space (space tugs) can only perform, on average, 25% as many missions as they're technically capable of due to the absence of refueling in space. \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f Furthermore, even if a spacecraft wanted to carry additional fuel, it is not easy. Current spacecraft require cryogenic fuels such as liquid oxygen, methane, and liquid hydrogen, which must be stored and transferred at extremely low temperatures of -285\u00b0F. \ud83e\udd76 Environmental factors in space, such as heat and radiation, increase the temperature of these fuels, causing them to boil off (vaporize). In addition, there is no current solution for spacecraft repair. This means that today's spacecraft must operate flawlessly to maximize efficiency, which is only sometimes the case. For instance, Eutelsat Communications' satellites experienced power loss mid-mission with no option for repair, resulting in a $30 million revenue loss. With Spaceium's multifunction robotic arm, the communication satellite could have been fixed. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Solution Automated servicing stations in space \ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f Our primary solution aims to improve space missions' efficiency by addressing refueling challenges. The developed cryogenic fuel storage and transfer technology is designed to store fuel without any boil-off for multiple years in space. As a result, spacecraft can now refuel in space, carry more payload, and travel longer distances. Two fundamental principles guide our proprietary Zero Boil Off (ZBO) technology.  Firstly, we prevent heat from entering the system through a unique tank design, insulation, and coating system. Secondly, our innovative multistage closed-loop cooling system evenly removes the heat from the cryogenic fuel and transfers it to radiators, ensuring zero boil-off.   Our cryogenic storage system is not only efficient but also highly scalable. Our current cooling system is 65% more efficient than any other cooling system, and our scalable storage system can store up to 30 metric tons of fuel, making it adaptable to a wide range of space missions and requirements. After successfully addressing the challenge of transporting large amounts of space fuel, we turned our attention to developing technology for delivering this fuel to spacecraft in space. This is achieved through the use of a multifunction robotic arm. This advanced arm can securely dock with incoming spacecraft and initiate the fuel transfer. The fluid system built within the arm allows the transfer of different fuel types through the robotic arm. The built-in thermal system ensures that fuel is transferred to the customer's spacecraft at the correct temperature without any boil-off issues associated with cryogenic fuels in space. Additionally, the same robotic arm is versatile enough to handle non-cryogenic fuels as well, providing a comprehensive solution for refueling spacecraft in space. In addition to safe and efficient fuel transfer, the robotic arm is equipped with an interchangeable end effector designed for in-space repairs. In-space repairs are achieved through a fully automated robotic arm that can retrieve tools from a stored \"toolbox\" within the system. This innovative feature ensures that even in the event of a significant issue, spacecraft can be repaired in space, minimizing the risk of mission failure and maximizing mission efficiency. Our vision is to transform the space industry. Starting in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), our servicing infrastructure will progressively expand to encompass Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), the moon, and eventually Mars. We are on a mission to empower space missions to go further, explore more, and achieve what was once deemed impossible.

The market size is considerable, encompassing content creators, businesses, and educational institutions. However, several factors must be considered.  Firstly, internet penetration and device capabilities vary across Latin American countries, impacting the accessibility and usability of the tool.  Secondly, cultural nuances in language and expression need to be accounted for in the AI model's training data to ensure accurate and natural-looking lip-sync.  Thirdly, pricing strategies must be adjusted to suit the economic landscape of different regions. A freemium model with tiered access based on usage or features might be a viable strategy.  Finally, marketing should highlight the tool's time-saving and cost-effective nature, emphasizing ease of use and language flexibility for a diverse audience.",

Our Visual Navigation System (VNS) uses cameras, an inertial measurement unit, and pre-loaded satellite imagery to determine it\u2019s position and send a fake GPS signal to any drone. Integrations typically take <30min. How It Started  In February, Carl was a Senior at Stanford, Sacha was a PhD student at Yale, and Ian was working with a British celebrity. After our post went viral, we spent weeks talking with troops on the ground, drone manufacturers, and DoD. We learned that: - The front lines of Ukraine are 100% GPS-denied - Cheap, DIY drones are extremely effective but typically rely on GPS - Existing GPS alternatives are extremely heavy and extremely expensive We set out to create a low-cost, low-weight replacement for GPS that works with any drone. How It\u2019s Going  Our first customer in the Special Forces has enabled us to push our VNS to its limits, and the results have been impressive. Here are a few excerpts from a memorandum written by the Captain we work with: \u201cHaving tested the Theseus\u2019 VizNav system for a week, I am convinced that their technology presents the best solution for a current, and ever-expanding urgent operational need.\u201d  \u201cAs a company, Theseus has shown a willingness to seek the ground truth from the operator and make improvements based on these recommendations immediately. The progress they have made with limited funding gives me incredible confidence that they act quicker and more efficiently than any other vendors we have worked with.\u201d  Due to the sensitive nature of our product, technical details and customer-specific information in this post will be limited. We are happy to discuss results in more detail privately. Going Forward  America is way behind. The current demand for drones in Ukraine is 1-2 million yearly. Every country in the world sees this and is in the process of building out its arsenal. Our product affordably enables an entirely new capability set for every one of these platforms. We have sold units to multiple customers, have six-figure LOIs from large drone manufacturers, integrations scheduled, and eight figures in funding for our VNS requested by the DoD for FY25. The West needs to build millions of drones, and all of those drones need Theseus.  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "This technology presents a significant challenge in the Latin American market. While the need for robust, GPS-denied drone navigation exists in certain sectors (e.g., surveillance, agriculture in remote areas, infrastructure inspection), the primary market addressed by Theseus (military/defense) is significantly smaller and less accessible in Hispanic Latin American countries.  Economic factors also play a crucial role; the high initial investment required for this specialized technology might hinder adoption in regions with lower defense budgets. Cultural nuances relating to government procurement processes and technology adoption rates also impact feasibility. The focus should shift from direct military sales to civilian applications with high potential (e.g., precision agriculture, infrastructure monitoring) to increase market viability within Latin America.",

He holds a MSc in Autonomous Vehicles Dynamics and Control from Cranfield University.Ramon GaratePretzel AI\u00a0Company LaunchesPretzel: Open-source & AI-native replacement for Jupyter Notebookstl;dr Hey everyone! We're Prasoon and Ramon from Pretzel AI, and we're building the modern Jupyter Notebook that fixes many longstanding problems with Jupyter. Pretzel improves on Jupyter with native support for AI tools like GitHub Copilot and LLMs, built-in collaboration (think Google Docs), an IDE-like code-writing experience (think VSCode), native support for SQL and Python, reactivity (so your notebooks are reproducible) and a visual data exploration and dashboarding suite. Best of all, we are fully open-source. As our first product, we\u2019ve built just one feature Pretzel: a visual data exploration tool that runs locally in the browser. See demo below or check us out on GitHub!   \u274c The Problem with Jupyter Notebooks Jupyter Notebook started in 2011 as a nicer, interactive way to work in Python. At the time, it was the best interactive tool to work with data really popular! It\u2019s currently used by millions of data scientists and analysts everyday. Despite it\u2019s popularity, there are many longstanding problems with Jupyter:  Notebooks do not reproduce reliably. Running cells out of order, running them multiple times, and hidden state can lead to inconsistent results. Collaboration is difficult. There's no easy way to work on a notebook with others in real time like you can with Google Docs. The code-writing experience is subpar compared to modern IDEs like VSCode. Features like intelligent autocomplete, linting, debugging, GitHub Copilot support and in-place editing with LLMs are all lacking. Integrating with other tools and languages can be clunky. While Jupyter supports kernels for other languages, you can't seamlessly switch between SQL and Python natively. Notebooks are still only usable by technical folks - i.e., data scientists and analysts. Most non-technical people still prefer using visual tools like Metabase or Tableau for their data needs.  \ud83e\udd68 The Solution: Introducing Pretzel We're building Pretzel to address these pain points by building the notebook experience for the modern day. Here's what makes Pretzel special:  AI-Powered: Pretzel integrates natively with AI tools like GitHub Copilot and large language models. Get intelligent code suggestions, understand, edit, and generate code right from your notebook. Reproducibility: Pretzel notebooks are reactive, meaning that cells update automatically when their dependencies change. This ensures your notebooks always stay in sync and produce consistent results. Collaboration: With Pretzel, you can collaborate on notebooks in real-time with others, just like in Google Docs. No more emailing notebooks back and forth or dealing with merge conflicts. IDE-like Experience: We're bringing the best parts of modern IDEs to Pretzel. Enjoy intelligent autocomplete, linting, debugging, testing, and more right in your notebook. Polyglot: Pretzel has first-class support for both SQL and Python. Switch seamlessly between languages in the same notebook. Open-Source: We believe in the power of open-source software. It eases adoption significantly (vs paid tools), has strong network effects and best of all, users can build their favorite features and contribute back to the community!  \ud83d\udca1 What Are We Doing Differently? Other tools like Hex have tried to fix problems with Jupyter. While Hex is a great product, it has been unable to displace Jupyter as the de facto data tool. Why? Because Open Source = Distribution and closed source tools have failed at distribution. With Pretzel, we tap into the same distribution mechanics as Jupyter to become the new de-facto data tool. With our free and open-source approach:  Way more people are able to try Pretzel for their work because it's free and self-serve - it can be installed just like Jupyter to run on your local machine without needing to worry about procurement cycles and data-sharing concerns. Network Effects come into play. When people contribute code into Pretzel to solve their problems, everyone benefits. The more people that use Pretzel, the more it\u2019s value. Enterprises are more willing to try Pretzel because they're not worried about us going out of business in two years!  We plan to monetize via cloud hosting and enterprise features (like SSO, compute, single-tenancy hosting, local LLM support etc). \ud83d\udce3 Ask We'd love to get your feedback on Pretzel and the features you would like to see! Email us at founders [at] withpretzel [dot] com or talk to us on GitHub. Here\u2019s a silly photo of us to wrap up the post :) Happy data wrangling! Prasoon and Ramon, Co-Founders of Pretzel AI  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Pretzel faces a significant challenge in the Latin American market. While Jupyter Notebooks are used globally, the target audience (data scientists and analysts) is relatively small compared to consumer-facing applications.  Economic factors also play a role; many companies in Latin America may prioritize cost-effective solutions over premium features, potentially hindering adoption of cloud hosting and enterprise features. Cultural nuances are less of a direct concern, as the product is technical and language-agnostic. However, successful implementation requires strong community building and localized support to overcome potential infrastructure and language barriers among developers in the region. Market education will be crucial, as many potential users may not be aware of Pretzel's advantages over Jupyter. The open-source nature is a strong advantage, enabling organic growth and community contributions, but it also means slower monetization.",

It offers the AI features of an editor like Cursor, while allowing you to host your own AI model locally and keep your data private. Check us out on GitHub!  About us Hi everyone, we\u2019re Mat and Andrew, and we\u2019re the team behind Void. Mat\u2019s been prompting Transformers since before GPT3 became mainstream, and Andrew did quantum computing research at JHU APL. We\u2019re best friends who have been programming together since we were 8.  left to right: Mat (CTO), Andrew (CEO) \u274c The problem: the leading AI IDE is closed source Cursor is a closed-source AI editor, which means you need to send your private data through Cursor\u2019s backend every time you use it. This leads to obvious privacy concerns. It\u2019s also expensive for developers, and it means one individual has full control over a powerful AI model. We think the future of AI should be open. You should be able to use whatever model you like and not be locked into using a privatized commercial one that\u2019s built to collect your data. \u2705 The solution: open source The solution: create an open-source Cursor alternative. This way, you can choose to self-host or communicate directly with any model you like, anywhere you like. There are lots of benefits to open-sourcing besides privacy, too: on Void, you can access community-made AI features beyond the ones that Cursor offers, and gain full access to all your prompts. Key features We\u2019re building a lot. Here are the features we\u2019re most excited about:  File system awareness: Void can answer questions about your entire codebase. It builds an index of all your files and uses it automatically, so you don\u2019t manually select relevant files. View and edit underlying prompts: Void lets you open up the hood and view/edit every single prompt in your chat history. This is really important if you want to understand how the LLM got its answer, and it\u2019s lacking in most closed-source tools. Fast edits across 1000s of lines: Even if your file is thousands of lines long, Void applies changes almost instantly. We prompt the AI to make changes the way a human would instead of rewriting the whole file.    Full privacy / data control: All of Void\u2019s prompt-building is done on your own computer. This means you can self-host your own model and have your data never leave your network. Or, you can connect directly to Claude, GPT, or Gemini, and not worry about sending your company data through a middle layer of communication.  We think the future of AI is open, and we\u2019re excited about building it. \ud83d\ude4f Asks  Check out the Void editor and star us on GitHub!

These are non-hardware costs associated with a solar project, and they amount to north of 60% of the total solar cost of an installed system! If you reduce this you create more demand for rooftop solar in the market = better outcome for our planet. Contributors to high soft costs:  PV CAD Design teams still manually build rooftop PV site designs. This is time-consuming and prone to lots of errors. Mistakes here mean re-doing plansets and permitting which can cost $1k - $2k extra. Almost all solar design tools are inaccurate in production and consumption modeling. This is what tells rooftop owners \u201cIs this the right investment for me?\u201d Most solar tools were built as a sidekick for sales reps, with just enough basic estimates to sell a solar proposal. Consumers are smarter now and recent legal litigations are forcing better modeling to be done when selling solar. Dependency on multiple platforms: Most solar companies use a software stack of 6 - 10 point solutions. Collectively the solution is dumb and creates chaotic workflows where deals get lost and project delays happen a lot. This is very expensive. Lack of project visibility across teams causing lost sales deals, and project delays  We estimate $5k to $ 7k added soft costs for a typical rooftop project occurring because of the above. \u2705 Solution: Aether is built to streamline the rooftop solar workflow end to end. Think Procore or Veeva but for Solar with an AI twist. With Aether, solar companies can rapidly generate PV site designs, sell using a beautiful PV proposal, and then manage it to installation in one simplified workflow. Aether is made up of hubs that help specific roles in a solar installation company do their job, but more importantly, collaborate with other teams as needed with the help of AI. Our two core innovations:  We built an in-house computer vision model. We also decided to build a mini fine-tuned model for solar. Being trained on items such as system production data, vision model outputs, etc. (Can\u2019t give the rest of our sauce away!)   The result is a unified AI platform to streamline solar with solar agents. Aether Platform - Sneak Peak   \ud83d\udcb2Opportunity: Aether will be a big player in the young and emerging Solar software vertical, which has a projected 20B Global TAM up for grabs by 2025. About Us Shelby and Zayne met at UC Berkeley close to a decade ago both originally being born in complete opposite ends of the world, France and Fiji. Shelby studied Materials Science and Engineering at UC Berkeley and was briefly headed for a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics before founding Aether.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Aether's AI-powered solar and roofing workflow software presents a significant challenge for direct implementation in the Hispanic Latin American market. While the global market for solar software is expanding, several factors hinder immediate success: \n\n* **Market Size and Adoption:** The rooftop solar market in many Latin American countries is less developed than in the US or Europe.  Lower electricity costs in some regions and financial accessibility limitations reduce demand.  Cultural factors and consumer awareness of solar energy also play a crucial role.  The initial market might need to focus on larger companies capable of adopting the advanced technology.\n* **Technical Infrastructure:** Reliable internet access and digital literacy vary significantly across Latin American countries.  The software's reliance on AI and computer vision might be constrained by limited bandwidth or device compatibility.\n* **Economic Factors:** The high initial investment required for purchasing and implementing Aether's software could be a barrier for many smaller businesses in the region.  Payment structures and financing options need careful consideration.\n* **Language and Localization:** Adapting the software's interface and documentation into multiple Spanish dialects (and potentially Portuguese in Brazil) is essential.  Cultural adaptations may also be needed to fully resonate with the users.",

It is an IDE extension built on top of our open-source tool, GPT Pilot, which has over 22k Github stars.  You start by describing an app you want to build; then, it asks you questions about the details of the app to write the full app specifications. Once the specs are done, it starts coding. When it finishes a task, it asks you to test the app and tell it if something is incorrect. It iterates with you by changing the code and asking you for feedback until the task is finished.

It is focused on building production-ready apps that you can deploy and use, so to achieve that, it keeps you, the human, in the loop throughout the entire development process. Pythagora manages the entire codebase and talks to you in natural language. \ud83e\udd28 Problem Today, new AI dev tools come out almost weekly. While many showcase impressive demos, very few prove their worth in building real-world, production-level applications. We think that this is because they don\u2019t put the human in the loop enough. There is a notion that apps can be built just by writing 2 sentences of what kind of an app you want, and then you just wait until AI comes back with a fully built application. We believe that humans have to be involved in the entire process of app development to give timely feedback so that AI can make changes as it works on specific features. \ud83d\udca1 solution  Pythagora talks to the user throughout the entire development process. First, it creates a plan for building the entire application. Then, it goes task by task, implementing each one, but before going on to the next one, it asks the user to test whether it\u2019s working as intended.

We just built the State of the Art for Browser Agents and wanted to share our learnings.  First, here\u2019s what 87% accurate Browser Agents look like:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G62KRiW4ses    Browser What? Browser Agents. Generalized agents that can perform a task on the internet via computer vision and reading the DOM.  How does it work  TL;DR our agent is a multi agent system composed of a planner, executor and critic engaged in debate over each action. The agents have varying degrees of vision and HTML DOM context. For more information please refer to https://trykura.com/technical-deep-dive.  Why is it better  This debate architecture allows it to self heal and backtrack succeeding in several tasks other agents currently fail at. It's also largely model agnostic allowing a user to lower costs by up to 90% when compared to Claude\u2019s Computer Use by swapping in cheaper models with slight impacts to accuracy.  Why does this matter We believe, because of many of the companies here, there will be more agents than humans on the internet in 10 years. However, the internet today is made for humans. Significant functionality is locked behind UIs which don\u2019t have APIs. That\u2019s where generalized browser agents come in. Our browser agent converts any series of UIs into an API ready for consumption by the next generation of agentic companies.   Schedule a demo ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Kura's technology, while cutting-edge, faces significant challenges in the Latin American market. The target audience is primarily developers and AI-focused companies, a relatively small niche in the region compared to consumer-facing applications.  Market penetration requires a strong focus on educating potential clients about the benefits of browser agents, which necessitates considerable marketing and sales efforts.  Economic factors also play a crucial role; the cost of implementing and maintaining Kura's solution might be prohibitive for many Latin American businesses, particularly smaller startups.  Furthermore, the existing digital infrastructure and internet penetration vary widely across Latin American countries, potentially limiting accessibility. While the long-term vision of a future dominated by AI agents is promising, immediate market viability needs careful consideration of these limitations.",

She is driven by immense curiosity and a love for solving complex problems in the supply chain industry.Elle SmythRetailReady\u00a0Sarah Hamer, FounderSarah graduated as an industrial engineer from Georgia Tech, was very involved in GT's entrepreneurship community and started her career at Microsoft. After a few years she missed the crazy, fast-paced startup life, and made the switch to Stord \u2013 a unicorn supply chain software startup. It was there that she saw retail compliance pain points first hand, met her co-founder, and decided to start RetailReady.Sarah HamerRetailReady\u00a0Company Launches\ud83d\udce6 RetailReady - Automating supply chain complianceWe\u2019re Sarah and Elle and we\u2019re excited to launch RetailReady!   \u23ea Backstory Before we joined YC, we worked at a supply chain unicorn startup called Stord where our jobs involved making their warehouse shipping facility run efficiently. While we were there, we realized that operations still largely relied on paper to pack an order correctly. Let me explain what actually happens in the warehouse when you order something from Walmart\u2026 \ud83c\udfaf TL;DR Every time workers in a warehouse box an order, they are supposed to reference 100+ page manuals that include precise packing instructions like where to put the shipping label. It\u2019s not practical for warehouse workers to check the manuals on every order, and thus mistakes happen. These mistakes result in hefty fines, amounting to $40B annually! RetailReady\u2019s mobile application replaces the paper manuals, making it easy to stay compliant and mitigate these fines, without any training time or integrations required. \ud83d\udd0d Problem Retailers (e.g. Walmart, Amazon, Target) outline unique shipping requirements for brands (think Dove, Hanes, Stanley) through 100+ page manuals called routing guides. If retailers receive a non-compliant shipment such as incorrect label placement, they issue brands a compliance violation fee, called chargebacks.  An example from page 227/399 of Walmart\u2019s guidelines\u2026  \u2026And how these shipping guidelines manifest on the warehouse floor today On average, 3% of a brand\u2019s gross invoice amount is deducted due to chargebacks, resulting in an estimated $40B worth of retailer chargebacks per year.  A subsection of violation fees outlined in a retailer routing guide On the flip side, when retailers receive these orders from brands, their warehouse team also uses their own printed routing guides to determine whether or not a shipment is compliant, and then manually enter associated fines into a spreadsheet. 10-12% of all orders retailers receive are deemed non-compliant and require 2X the labor time. \ud83e\uddbe Solution RetailReady is the ultimate retail compliance solution for all stakeholders, requiring no training time or integrations. Third-Party Logistics (3PLs): Our user-friendly mobile application ensures operational shipping compliance to retailers. Our software ingests retailer routing guides and translates them into step-by-step workflow tasks while providing a visual repository of every order for dispute resolution.  Brands: Our dashboard offers insights into your or your 3PL's operations, allowing you to upload chargebacks. This data enhances our model, tailoring your packing process with extra validation checks.  Retailers: Our retailer mobile app automatically detects and records shipping compliance errors from vendors, speeding up revenue generation and increasing labor efficiency. \ud83d\udc4bOur Ask  If you know any brands / 3PLs that are struggling with retailer compliance or retailers that are struggling with vendor compliance, we\u2019d love warm intros!

Company PhotoHear from the foundersWhat is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?If retailers receive a non-compliant order, they issue a chargeback to brands. On average, 3% of a brand\u2019s gross invoice amount is deducted due to chargebacks, resulting in an estimated $40B worth of retailer chargebacks per year. We realized this problem after leading warehouse operation shifts together and witnessing first-hand that shipping compliance was not tracked nor enforced systemically, but rather done by manually following 100+ page retailer requirement documents.

THE TEAM Hey YC! We\u2019re Saroop and Tom, the founders of Senso.\u00a0Over the past decade, we\u2019ve been developing AI solutions for banks and credit unions, which provide marketing and support teams with insights to boost customer retention rates.   Consider the following scenarios, which we see happen over and over again:  You contact your financial institution only to be put on hold for up to 10 minutes and then transferred to another department. You get offers which are not at all relevant to your life circumstances.  Sound familiar? This type of experience has become the norm in industries like financial services leading to frustrated customers and missed opportunities. PROBLEM We\u2019ve started in the US Credit Union industry.\u00a0Why Credit Unions? Because expanding member relationships is their highest priority. Currently, inefficient means in accessing information, policies and procedures, and past behavior bring unexpected overhead.\u00a0 A few examples:  Service Delays: 40% of members are put on hold by support teams, sometimes for up to 5-7 minutes, due to difficulties in accessing policies, procedures, and member information. Marketing Relevance: Marketing teams face 2-4 week delays in obtaining behavioral data, resulting in missed opportunities to provide personalized service.  These challenges, common across nearly 5000 Credit Unions, stem from an inefficient system for aggregating data and surfacing member behavior, intent, interactions, and policies & procedures in a timely fashion. SOLUTION Senso is building an AI-powered Knowledge Base designed for traditional enterprises, starting with Credit Unions. Our product provides a flexible way to centralize enterprise knowledge, such as documents and conversational data, that LLMs utilize to improve information flow across support and marketing teams. Our GTM strategy is to partner with industry leaders to distribute our product. In the Credit Union space, we\u2019ve partnered with CU 2.0 to launch an industry-specific version of Senso called\u00a0CuCopilot, built using our APIs. Here\u2019s an example of how our growing customer base is using our product to provide more timely and personalized service to members.   Ingest and summarize thousands of conversations so that support and marketing teams can understand what members are asking. Examples of metrics surfaced are sentiment and call purpose.    In this example, the Credit Union decides to track members speaking about loan and account openings, and sets a frequency to auto-generate weekly FAQ\u2019s based on interactions.    Once the FAQ is generated, support agents can better answer questions related to loan and account openings by searching for auto-generated responses.    One of our customers, TruStone Financial, has seen a significant uptick in the speed in which they are able to answer questions, and their documentation has improved response quality significantly.  ASKS FROM FOUNDERS  Know anyone at a Credit Union? \u00a0If our product may be of interest to anyone running a P&L, an introduction would be appreciated. Developers: \u00a0We\u2019ve onboarded API partners like TribalScale and Fundmore to launch AI-powered knowledge bases in their products and industries.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Usul's focus on assisting US companies in securing defense contracts presents a limited market within Latin America.  The direct applicability of this solution to the Hispanic market is extremely low.  While some Latin American countries may have defense sectors, the scale and structure differ significantly from the US DoD.  Furthermore, the specific AI-driven market analysis and contact mapping functionalities are highly tailored to the US government's procurement processes and are unlikely to be directly transferable.  The cultural context (relationships, contracting processes) and economic conditions differ substantially, rendering direct adaptation challenging and costly.  The existing market for this type of software in Latin America is likely very small and niche.",

        "mvp": "Given the low market adaptability, a direct MVP replication is not recommended.  Instead, a thorough market research phase should precede any development.  This research should focus on identifying potential analogous markets (e.g., large government contracts within Latin American countries).  The MVP should then involve conducting detailed interviews with key decision-makers within these relevant government agencies to understand their procurement processes and needs. This qualitative data will help determine the feasibility of adapting Usul's AI capabilities to a specific Latin American context before investing heavily in software development."

        "feasibility_analysis": "EdgeTrace's high-precision video search technology presents a significant challenge in the Latin American market due to several factors.  The market size for advanced video analytics is smaller than in developed nations, particularly for niche applications like those mentioned.  High internet bandwidth requirements and variable infrastructure quality across regions pose a hurdle.  Furthermore, cultural nuances and language barriers need careful consideration when designing user interfaces and marketing materials. Economic factors also play a crucial role; many potential clients, particularly smaller businesses, may lack the budget for a sophisticated video analytics solution.  The focus should initially be on specific, high-value sectors (e.g., security, logistics in larger cities) where the ROI is more easily demonstrable.  A phased rollout targeting specific countries with better infrastructure could be more successful.  Building trust and local partnerships will be key for adoption.",

He is broadly interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Infrastructure. He led the AI Platform at Tesla Autopilot, which enabled large-scale training, model evaluation, monitoring, and observability for Tesla's full self-driving development. Prior to that, Deshraj created EvalAI, an open source ML platform, as his master's thesis at Georgia Tech. He has published papers at top AI conferences like CVPR, ECCV, AAAI etc.Deshraj YadavMem0\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesMem0 - Open Source Memory Layer for AI AppsTL;DR Mem0 is an open-source memory layer for AI applications. It solves the problem of stateless LLMs by efficiently storing and retrieving user interactions, enabling personalized AI experiences that improve over time. Our hybrid datastore architecture combines graph, vector, and key-value stores to make AI apps personalized and cost-efficient. Watch our explainer video here.   \u2014 Hey everyone! We're Taranjeet and Deshraj, and we built Mem0 to solve a big problem we faced with LLMs while building Embedchain (an open-source RAG framework with 2M+ downloads). LLMs don\u2019t have memory, so they forget everything after each session. This leads to inefficient and repetitive interactions, making it hard to create personalized AI experiences. Think about having to repeat your preferences over and over again, and how frustrating that gets! Mem0 changes that. \u274c The Problem LLMs are stateless\u2014they don\u2019t remember anything between sessions. Every time you interact with them, you have to provide the same context, which gets repetitive and wastes computational resources. This makes AI apps less useful and personalized over time. \u2728 Our Solution  Mem0 adds a memory layer to AI applications, making them stateful which allows them to store and recall user interactions, preferences, and relevant context. This way, AI apps evolve with every interaction, delivering more personalized and relevant responses without needing large context blocks in each prompt. To make this possible, we needed to create a system that could efficiently manage and retrieve all the relevant information AI apps collect over time. That\u2019s where Mem0\u2019s hybrid datastore architecture comes in, making AI smarter and more efficient as it learns. \u2699\ufe0f How it works Mem0 employs a hybrid datastore architecture that combines graph, vector, and key-value stores to store and manage memories effectively. Here\u2019s the breakdown:  Adding memories: When you use Mem0 with your AI App, it automatically detects and stores the important parts of your messages or interactions. Organizing information: Mem0 categorizes memories in three ways:  Key-value stores for quick access to structured data (facts, preferences). Graph stores for understanding relationships (like people, places, objects). Vector stores for capturing the overall meaning and context of conversations, allowing AI apps to find similar memories later.   Retrieving memories: When an input query is received, Mem0 searches for and retrieves relevant memories using a combination of graph traversal techniques, vector similarity, and key-value lookups. It prioritizes the most important, relevant, and recent information, ensuring that the AI has the right context, no matter how much memory is stored.  Watch this video for a demo of our playground in action here   \ud83d\ude4f Our Asks  Try out Mem0! We guarantee that your users will have personalized interactions after adding Mem0 in your AI apps.

We are applying this technology to clinically tested, but highly toxic cancer immunotherapies to make them safer and more effective. Who we are/Team: SynsoryBio was founded by brother scientists, Elliot and Nathan, who both hold PhDs in biomedical engineering. The founders gained expertise in synthetic biology at Boston University, Harvard Medical School, and industrial biotech, where they authored numerous high-impact journal publications and are inventors on several patent filings. SynsoryBio harnesses this expertise to create next-generation therapeutics that understand where they are in the body and only act at the site of disease.  The Problem: The most potent therapeutics suffer from safety issues and dose limitations, impeding their development and overall efficacy. This isn\u2019t surprising because most therapeutics are delivered systemically and are active throughout the body even though the underlying disease is localized to a certain tissue. For example, immunotherapies to treat cancer show great promise but usually exhibit dose limitations, especially in combination, which prevents the development of potent immune stimulators and/or mitigates clinical efficacy.  The Synsory Solution: We are developing next-generation protein therapeutics that have synthetic sensing functions so that they know where they are in the body and only act at disease tissue. Our approach is highly flexible, allowing us to design protein therapeutics that conditionally activate upon sensing virtually any specified biomolecule.

        "feasibility_analysis": "OpenCall.ai presents a compelling opportunity in the Latin American market.  Many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the region struggle with efficient customer service, and an AI-powered solution could significantly improve operations and reduce costs. However, several factors need consideration.  Market size varies greatly across countries; penetration in more technologically advanced nations like Chile or Mexico would likely be higher than in smaller economies with less robust internet infrastructure.  Cultural nuances are crucial; the AI's voice and interaction style should be adapted to local preferences and languages, avoiding overly formal or informal tones.  Economic factors, like affordability and pricing strategies, are key; OpenCall needs to offer competitive pricing models, possibly including tiered service plans to cater to different business sizes and budgets.  The high cost of phone calls in some regions also needs to be accounted for, and potential integration with local telecom providers should be investigated. Furthermore, language support beyond Spanish (e.g., Portuguese for Brazil) would be essential for broader market reach.",

While working on our previous idea, we spent 20 hours each week checking the websites of hundreds of companies to see if they met our target criteria. We wanted to automate this process, but we couldn\u2019t find any good options. APIs were too limited and none of the web automation tools worked. It turned out that other founders were also looking for solutions to this problem. More generally, knowledge workers are spending hours doing repetitive tasks, which can\u2019t be automated with current tools. We found HR teams filling out admin forms, Operations processing orders, and Sales manually prospecting. \u2601\ufe0f CloudCruise automates repetitive work in the browser CloudCruise processes a list of items with a step-by-step workflow. You can use our tool to grab any list on the web, or you can upload a CSV. Workflows are made up of a series of actions like inputting text, clicking elements, or extracting data from a page. Each step can be LLM-powered, so CloudCruise can translate general instructions like \u201cfind contact page\u201d to a click action and DOM element on any website. This works even if the website layout is unpredictable or DOM elements are rotated. CloudCruise works right next to you, in a tab of your browser.

We\u2019re helping enterprises break large codebases into small pieces.  We first met as roommates in college, and in the decade since we've both worked exclusively at startups, including multiple founding engineering roles. We ran into this problem time and time again as our startups began to scale.  We're now working with a wide range of companies, including a number of multi-billion $ enterprises. Our open source tooling also has ~1k stars on GitHub, over 400k downloads, and is in use by Nvidia.  In the short term, Gauge is building tools to modularize the monolith. Long term, Gauge is building a way to deploy a single codebase as a set of independent services, giving you the scalability of microservices alongside the simplicity of monolithic development.Latest NewsAI Makes Tech Debt More ExpensiveNov 14, 2024Parsing Python ASTs 20x Faster with RustJun 17, 2024GaugeFounded:2024Team Size:2Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Diana Hu\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersCaelean Barnes, FounderCEO at Gauge - open source dev tools to solve the microservices/monolith dilemma.

We\u2019re doing this by enabling teams to build a modular monolith. Our first tool is called Tach, and it brings some of the power of microservices to your monolith, without all of the headaches. \ud83d\ude4f\u00a0Our Ask  Are you undergoing a microservices <> monolith migration? We\u2019d love to learn from your experience! Are you scaling a Python monorepo? Give Tach a try (and a \u2b50)! It\u2019s open source and free.  If any of the above resonates with you, we\u2019d love to buy you a drink! Grab a time with the founders here. \u26a0\ufe0f\u00a0The Problem Startups need to move fast. As they grow, code quality takes a back seat to velocity, inevitably leading to code sprawl and tightly coupled services. This creates an environment where even simple features and refactors become incredibly painful. Once startups reach this stage, they often reach for microservices.  Unfortunately, this is like trying to fix a dirty kitchen by building a new house for the sink. With microservices, you introduce a whole new world of challenges - orchestration, lifecycle management, versioning dependencies, and more. \u2699\ufe0f\u00a0The Solution By separating a monolith into decoupled modules with well defined interfaces, you get the benefits of microservices without the immense complexity that comes with it. Our first tool, Tach, lets you do just that. We recently rewrote the core in Rust (~19x speedup), added visualization, and shipped test impact analysis support! We\u2019re currently live in production with a number of companies, have over 300k downloads, and over 900 stars on GitHub. An example of Tach on the FastAPI repo  Next, we\u2019re building more tools to help you scale a modular monolith - architecture enforcement, intelligent cached task execution, smart build and deployment pipelines, and more. Long term, we\u2019re excited by a new approach that will allow you to deploy your modular monolith as a set of independent services. This will bring over the remaining set of benefits that microservices offer, including independent scalability and fault tolerance. Google recently put out a paper describing this idea. While the FAANGs have bespoke in-house solutions, the rest of the industry is far behind. We see an opportunity to bring this capability to everyone. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\u00a0About Us Evan and I (Caelean) met as roommates in college, and in the decade since, we\u2019ve both worked exclusively at startups, including multiple founding engineering roles. We\u2019ve seen attempts to split up the monolith drain millions of dollars in engineering hours and ultimately fail. At every startup we\u2019ve helped build, we\u2019ve run into the problem of how to maintain development velocity as the team and codebase scales. We\u2019re building the tools that we wish we had.

We\u2019re focusing on the main bottleneck in healthcare - clinical expertise. Our AI thinks like a doctor. It conducts comprehensive medical histories via voice interface, performs medical reasoning, and suggests evidence-based treatments / next steps (99% of the healthcare journey).

The US healthcare system is facing a physician crisis  Projected shortage of 86,000 physicians by 2036 30% of physicians are leaving the field or moving part-time in the next 5 years due to the lack flexibility or burnout. Patient volumes per physician are exploding, overwhelming doctors' capacity to deliver quality care   Existing attempts to solve these problems have been step changes, and fail to lessen the burden of care on doctors:  Traditional Telehealth simply moved the same broken workflows online, amounting to the same workload, if not more (\u201dI think you\u2019re on mute, Mrs. Jones\u2026\u201d) Asynchronous messaging currently requires a lot of back and forth and hasn\u2019t achieved adoption Administrative streamlining AI services are great, but don\u2019t tackle the fundamental bottleneck in healthcare which is clinical expertise.    The Solution OpenClinic is an EHR platform that powers digital medical clinics with sophisticated AI that handles 99% of the work, letting doctors focus purely on medical decision-making. Our platform:  Takes comprehensive medical histories through an empathetic voice interface Uses advanced medical reasoning to narrow down diagnoses Provides evidence-based treatment suggestions Presents doctors with concise text-based summaries, with all key findings cited Enables asynchronous care delivery without video/phone calls Built-in safety protocols flag potential contraindications and risks.

Problem Customer support is one of those rare opportunities for a brand to connect directly with its users. The best brands know this and invest heavily in coaching their human agents to deliver a great support experience. But when it comes to automated support, most solutions rely on LLMs that aren\u2019t specially designed for customer support and can\u2019t learn from experience. This often leaves users stuck with impersonal and long FAQ-style responses in small chat windows, often missing the help they actually need. Internal teams might see some early wins with a public LLM + RAG setup, but that progress usually hits a wall fast.

Today, we are launching the first part of our experience: a tool to create and iterate on funnel slides with the ability to export them to Google Slides in one click. \ud83d\udea8 The Problem Over 30 million presentations are created daily. Countless important decisions are made at companies every day based on a presentation. However, it takes too long and most people lack the skill to make a presentation that effectively gets the point across. We believe that this is because of 3 main reasons:  \u201cBlank page\u201d problem:\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to get started staring at an empty deck. In our experience at tech companies, most information required to create the presentation already existed in other docs/tools and it still took a lot of time to get started. Busywork: A lot of time is spent finding the right slide template, fitting content into it, and struggling with other design details. This is especially painful when trying to change the structure like splitting a slide into multiple slides etc. Too much text, not enough visuals: Creating good visuals is hard and therefore a lot of presentations are text-heavy. People find it challenging to think of the right visual as well as being able to put it together.   \ud83c\udfaf The Solution Alai is an AI-first presentation experience:  Get multiple slide options: Just put in text and Alai will show you multiple high-quality options to choose from. Built-in iteration loop with AI: Iterate on the complicated design elements of your slide using natural language. AlaI also considers your manual edits when suggesting new options.  Yet another AI presentation tool? We think most of these tools are missing the point. Generating an entire presentation in one go leaves you with low-quality slides that still require a lot of polishing. We believe we can do better!

We\u2019re Philip and Louis, the co-founders of Glasskube. TLDR: Glasskube is an open source package manager for Kubernetes that makes deploying, updating, and configuring packages on Kubernetes 20x faster than tools like Helm or Kustomize. Inspired by the simplicity of Homebrew and npm, our goal is to build enterprise-ready infrastructure software that can run mission-critical workloads across the more than 3 million Kubernetes clusters globally. Glasskube is fully open source. Check out our repository on GitHub. (We'd appreciate a star \ud83c\udf1f)  The Backstory & Problem Kubernetes packages have been growing rapidly, from around 100 packages in 2016 to over 800 packages on the CNCF landscape today. With more than 7 million developers working with Kubernetes, Helm, an open-source tool created during a hackathon nine years ago, has become the go-to solution. However, Helm struggles to keep up with the increasing demand, leading to complex workflows and non-standardized solutions. Over the past five years, writing and deploying packages on Kubernetes, we found ourselves defaulting to Helm despite its shortcomings due to a lack of alternatives. While working on other cloud-native projects, users consistently highlighted common pain points with Helm. This realization prompted us to tackle the larger issue of package management in Kubernetes, leading to the development of Glasskube. What is Glasskube? Glasskube brings the experience of Homebrew or npm to your Kubernetes cluster. It simplifies installation, updates, and configuration, making it easier and faster to manage your packages.  Focusing on simplicity and reliability with our CLI and UI Easily install packages in your cluster via the Glasskube UI, where all packages are conveniently located, eliminating the need to search for a Helm repository. Safe Package Updates Preview and perform pending updates to your desired version with a single click (or CLI command). All updates are pre-tested by the Glasskube test suite. Package configurations Configure packages with typesafe input values via the UI or interactive CLI questionnaire. Inject values from other packages, ConfigMaps, and Secrets easily. No more untyped and undocumented values.yaml files. GitOps Integration All Glasskube packages are custom resources, manageable via GitOps. We're also integrating with renovate.   Read also more about dependency management, multiple repositories and private packages on our website. Interested? Check out our Demo.   Our Vision Currently, we are focused on enhancing the user experience, aiming to save engineers as much time as possible by building on top of existing technologies. In the future, we plan to develop an entirely new packaging and bundling format for all cloud-native packages. This will provide package developers with a straightforward way to define how to install and configure packages, offer simple upgrade paths, and enable us to provide feedback, crash reports, and analytics to every developer working on Kubernetes packages, similar to how Android supports Play Store developers. Presignup - Glasskube Cloud We are currently working on Glasskube Cloud, for which you can now pre-signup. Key features include:  Cloud Hosted Private Packages Security Alerts and Update Notifications Advanced GitOps Integrations (intelligent insights on upgrade success probability, smart config migration suggestions, enhanced open PRs showing detailed changes at manifest/resource level)  Our Asks We love talking to engineers and anyone interested in DevOps who uses Kubernetes.

While the need for efficient healthcare systems is universal, several factors limit direct applicability.  The market size varies considerably across countries; some have robust private healthcare sectors while others rely heavily on underfunded public systems.  Technological infrastructure limitations (internet access, EHR adoption) in many regions pose a considerable hurdle. Cultural nuances in patient-provider communication and data privacy regulations must be carefully considered.  Furthermore, the economic landscape dictates affordability, posing a challenge for an AI-based solution that may require significant upfront investment.

The Problem \u2013 Why getting high-quality code data is so hard From our experience training models, we believe the biggest bottleneck of progressing vertical LLM capabilities is the lack of curated, high-quality training data. Acquiring this high-quality data is difficult because:  Consistent, high-quality code data cannot be synthetically generated or scraped. Tasks are often too challenging or specific for even the most capable models, and even a few incorrect samples can noticeably worsen the final training results. Hiring human annotators is tricky. Manual data labeling en masse tends towards low-skill gig work; it\u2019s difficult to hire and retain highly competent engineers as annotators.  The Solution We solve the data problem with our gamified annotation platform that attracts the best engineers to come and solve fun coding problems. We have already brought on top competitive programmers, as well as highly competent engineers who have worked at companies like Amazon and AMD. In general, we get great engineers who\u00a01) already have good careers, and\u00a02) already enjoy doing programming challenges outside of work.

My name is Daniel, and I'm the founder of Alex: The missing sidebar for Xcode \ud83c\udf4f Being an iOS Developer since I was 13, Xcode is rooted in my DNA. I admittedly really like Xcode (when it\u2019s not crashing), and I find it feature-complete for almost everything I need as a developer \u2014 except one: AI codegen. That\u2019s where Alex comes in. Alex - Your AI Copilot for Xcode   TL;DR \ud83e\uddf5 Alex is like Cursor for Xcode, and gives you AI features like sidebar chat, inline completions, and tab to complete. Since launching last week, over 1200 users have signed up for Alex, and hundreds are using it every day for their work. We want to make Software Development easier for the 3+ million people who use Xcode. Check out our website to get started! https://alexcodes.app How does it work? Alex interacts with Xcode using MacOS's Accessibility features. It can read what you see on Xcode, and can write to it. It also knows where your cursor is, so it can accurately place the suggestions and \"Fix Error\" buttons.   Alex also embeds your Xcode projects for use in Codebase Search. We let you connect to any custom OpenAI-compatible model, or use your own keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and VoyageAI. What next? At Alex, we want to make high-quality iOS development significantly faster. We plan on doing two major things in the future:   Creating the iOS LLMs. With each new iOS release and iOS SDK, new APIs are introduced into Swift and SwiftUI, and more APIs get deprecated. The state-of-the-art models like OpenAI and Anthropic either don't have the latest iOS code baked into their knowledge, or their top-1 retrieval doesn\u2019t correspond with the latest APIs. This is because there simply isn't enough training data from new iOS APIs, and not enough data indicating deprecated code. We plan to create our own model, trained using Apple's latest documentation, and available both as large-scale model finetunes for chat, and as smaller scale finetunes for inline suggestions.   Creating your own local iOS agent. Our long term plan is creating your own local iOS Development agent. Imagine Alex running several tasks in the background: Code refactors, optimizations, tests, documentation, and bug fixing all done in the background \u2014 while you do the most exciting part: Feature development.   Conclusion (and a signup deal!) It's been exciting to see teams fully switch from their Cursor/Xcode setup to just using Xcode with Alex.

When chemists need to make a drug we use AI to define parameters such as temperature, concentration and catalyst. This enables new chemistries and makes synthesis faster and cheaper. Check out our product here: www.yonedalabs.com/yoneda-optimize Who we are  We are three University of Cambridge grads combining expertise in Computer Science and Chemistry, with a leader in the field, Prof Scott E Denmark as our advisor. Combined, we have experience working in Bayer, Berkeley AI Research, Jane Street, Optiver and Cisco. Jan ranked top 11 in the International Chemistry Olympiad for 3 years in a row. Problem: There are more than 10M different compounds created each year. Chemists need to figure out how to make them. To do so, they often rely on literature data. Unfortunately, this data almost never contains the exact recipe and the ones out there are often misreported and irreproducible in the lab. This means that chemists still need to frequently rely on their intuition, and when that fails, a potentially life-saving drug might never see the light of day.  Solution: Foundation model for chemical reactions We are generating our own dataset of chemical experiments. We will use it to train a powerful model capable of defining good conditions for any organic reaction. We\u2019ve performed feasibility studies on smaller datasets and confirmed our beliefs that if we choose the experiments very carefully, we will be able to cover 3 of the most popular reactions in organic chemistry with only 20k data points. We\u2019ve already created an app that learns from the chemists\u2019 experimental data as they run their reactions in the lab. This allows them to find the optimal conditions in days instead of weeks or months. Our custom algorithms allow the app to run fully offline from the chemist's PC to account for data sensitivity. Additionally, we designed the app to be simple to use so that every chemist can employ state-of-the-art statistics and machine learning in their lab in just a few clicks.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Yoneda Labs' foundation model for chemical manufacturing faces significant challenges in the Latin American market. While the need for efficient reaction optimization exists globally, the implementation requires careful consideration.  Market size for this highly specialized software is relatively small compared to broader software markets.  Cultural nuances may impact adoption; convincing chemists to trust and adopt AI-driven tools might require extensive outreach and demonstrations emphasizing reliability and accuracy. Economic factors, including the budget constraints of many Latin American chemical companies, could limit the immediate market penetration.  Furthermore, the need for a strong internet connection and potentially high computational demands may hinder adoption in areas with limited infrastructure.  Targeting larger pharmaceutical companies or CROs in more developed Latin American nations (e.g., Brazil, Mexico, Argentina) might be a more realistic initial strategy, focusing on a gradual expansion to other regions as the market matures.",

Our proprietary (nanoparticle-free) technology, which we call \u2018STAmP\u2019, stabilizes the mRNA and utilizes an interchangeable, lock-and-key-like targeting mechanism which enables fully customizable mRNA medicines.ParcelBioFounded:2023Team Size:3Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Surbhi Sarna\u00a0Active FoundersDavid Weinberg, FounderDavid is the co-founder and CEO of ParcelBio. He was previously VP of RNA Platform at Orbital Therapeutics / Circ Bio, where he led the development of a circular RNA therapeutics platform. Before that, he was Sr. Director of Molecular Research at Freenome, where he built the multiomics diagnostics platform that enabled a blood test for the early detection of cancer\u200b. David obtained his PhD from MIT, was a UCSF Faculty Fellow, and has been honored with Forbes \u201830 Under 30\u2019 and an NIH DP5 Award.David WeinbergParcelBio\u00a0Chris Carlson, FounderChris is the co-founder and CSO of ParcelBio. He was previously a scientist at Orbital Therapeutics, where he was the primary contributor on multiple patents regarding stabilization of therapeutic RNAs. Chris obtained his PhD from UCSF where he studied RNA packaging and protection in viruses.Chris CarlsonParcelBio\u00a0Company LaunchesParcelBio: Programmable delivery of mRNA medicinesSummary: ParcelBio is addressing the biggest problem in RNA therapeutics: delivery. We are developing a programmable technology to safely and specifically deliver mRNA to diverse cell types in the body. We will initially use this technology to develop drugs for long-overlooked kidney disorders, chronic liver diseases, and immune system dysregulation\u2014but that\u2019s just the beginning.  The Problem: mRNA therapeutics have already saved millions of lives with the advent of the COVID-19 vaccine. We believe they can save millions more. That\u2019s because mRNA is a versatile therapeutic: It can be programmed to produce just about anything the body could need. The key hurdle limiting the full therapeutic potential of mRNA is delivery; it\u2019s hard to get enough mRNA exactly where it needs to go. To safely and efficiently deliver an mRNA therapeutic requires a delivery vehicle that imparts two features: stability and targeting. The current delivery vehicle of choice is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which is essentially a fat droplet that encapsulates the mRNA. LNPs work great for vaccines, but applications beyond vaccines require more specific targeting and higher doses than what best-in-class LNP technologies can provide. Our Solution: Our proprietary technology, which we call \u2018STAmP\u2019 (Stabilization and Targeting by Annealing mRNA to ParcelOligos), is a completely new way of delivering an mRNA medicine without a nanoparticle. STAmP\u2019s key innovation is the use of \u2018ParcelOligos\u2019, which was inspired by the clinical success of another type of RNA therapeutic called siRNA that has already moved on from nanoparticle-based delivery. ParcelOligos bind to an mRNA molecule to convert it into a more stable form so that it can survive the journey to desired cell types. In addition to imparting stability, ParcelOligos are attached to interchangeable \u2018keys\u2019 that only unlock cells with the corresponding lock. These keys are based on naturally occurring molecules that the body already uses to recognize specific cell types. We will use STAmP to develop wholly-owned drugs for kidney, liver, and immune system disorders. We will also partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to make improved mRNA vaccines and to deliver CRISPR gene-editing tools to diverse cell types. The Team: David holds a PhD from MIT where he studied the function of siRNAs, was a faculty member at UCSF investigating mRNA biology, and most recently was the Vice President of RNA Platform at a leading mRNA therapeutics startup, Orbital Therapeutics. Chris received his PhD from UCSF where he studied RNA protection in viruses. He was hired by David at Orbital Therapeutics, where he went on to author multiple pending patents related to the stabilization of therapeutic RNAs.  Our Ask: We would appreciate any introductions to investors or potential drug-development partners\u2014especially those interested in making better vaccines and delivering CRISPR gene-editing tools to diverse cell types. Reach out to us at founders@parcelbio.com! ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "This startup, focused on mRNA delivery technology, presents significant challenges for the Latin American market.  The high technical complexity and capital intensity of mRNA therapeutics development and manufacturing make it unlikely to be feasible in the short-term, especially considering the limited biotech infrastructure in many Hispanic countries. Market size for such specialized treatments within the region is also considerably smaller compared to developed nations. Cultural nuances related to healthcare access and trust in new technologies will need extensive consideration.  Economic factors, such as limited healthcare spending and regulatory hurdles, further complicate the viability of this venture in the Latin American context. A potential niche could involve partnering with larger pharmaceutical companies already established in the region to leverage their infrastructure and distribution networks, but this is highly dependent on successful fundraising and securing strong partnerships in the US first.",

You can self-host our software or use our managed service to reduce your cloud costs by 3-10x. Hey everyone \ud83d\udc4b We\u2019re Umur, Daniel, and Ozgun from Ubicloud. We\u2019re on a mission to rebuild the cloud market with different values. More on us below. The Problem  AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud make life easier for start-ups and enterprises. But they are closed source, have you rent computers at a huge premium, and lock you in. It gets worse after your credits expire. Although the cloud came in with savings in its early years, the market evolved into a few players that overcharge for non-differentiated services, with increasingly complex products for standard, essential services. Each vendor optimizing for their walled gardens leaves customers stuck maintaining their apps and infra across incompatible clouds. The cloud is here to stay. We believe a simpler, secure, and open source version of it will have a lasting impact. The Solution Ubicloud offers an open source alternative, reduces your costs, and returns control of your infrastructure back to you \u2014 all without sacrificing the cloud\u2019s benefits. We\u2019re starting with elastic compute, virtual networking, block storage (non-replicated), managed PostgreSQL, and powerful IAM. Our managed cloud runs on cost-effective bare metal providers, such as Hetzner. As a result, you can reduce your costs by 3-10x. Example use-cases:  GitHub Actions: Change 1-line in your workflow file. Reduce costs by 10x Compute for batch processing: Run data pipelines for AI, scientific computing, and video processing - on-demand and encrypted. Reduce costs by 3x (vs AWS VMs) Managed PostgreSQL: Open source and portable. Uses local NVMes for higher performance, ideal for analytics. Reduce costs by 3x (vs AWS RDS)  The Team  \u201cNever tell me the odds.\u201d \u2014 Han Solo We think the cloud galaxy deserves a solution that stands for open source values.

Our mantra: \"Stop Summarizing, Start Analyzing!\" The Due-Diligence Dilemma Private equity funds are struggling to find and win the right deals because due diligence is time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to:  Only assessing ~20% of deals due to limited resources Wasting time on the wrong deals and missing out on the right deals Missing critical details leads to losing millions or sometimes billions Failing to discover the hidden insights that help win deals and generate alpha  The Only Platform Built Around the Investor's Thought Process   Instantly generate thousands of complex analyses from raw data    Extract critical insights from each analysis (trends, anomalies, narratives, etc.) For Example: \u201cEach successive cohort's initial average revenue per customer decreases (2008: $61.7K, 2009: $29.1K, 2010: $25.2K, 2011: $18.1K), indicating a concerning downward trend in the average value of new customers.\u201d    Create and personalize analyses based on the fund and industry    Gain unparalleled visibility into your entire deal history and unlock the shared intelligence within. Proof Is In The Pudding \u201cWe recently did a deal and initially analyzed cohorts on a yearly basis, and while it looked good overall, we later found an issue in Q2 that only came up after speaking with the management team. By then, the team had invested so much time that it didn\u2019t make sense to go back and redo everything quarterly.

We\u2019re Marie and Michael from Markprompt. We are building AI infrastructure to power customer support at scale. We are live with companies like AngelList, Mindbody, and Plotly.  Problem  Scaling customer support with headcount is expensive: Human resources account for 90%+ of customer support expenses. Customer support agents burn out: Support tasks incur large amounts of manual, repetitive, and ungratifying work that humans don't need to be doing, causing burnout, turnover, and reduced quality. Customer support is more than a chatbot on a website: In an API-driven world, customer support tools need to evolve with the company\u2019s tech stack. Existing AI-powered solutions are not delivering on the promise, resulting in sub-par customer experience and low NPS and CSAT scores. Company resources are siloed across systems: As companies grow, so does their expert knowledge. It is hard to access at scale, and keeping employees up-to-date is nearly impossible.  Solution  Comprehensive data indexing: Markprompt addresses the root of the information access problem by indexing all available knowledge within a company, setting the foundation for a robust system of record to feed the AI.

We generate predictions for mineral deposit shapes and locations, empowering mining companies from initial exploration to advanced feasibility studies.  Geologists need to know precisely where their deposits are because drilling is expensive. In early trials with a lithium mining company, we found that Mineflow predicts the shape of hard rock lithium deposits more than an order of magnitude more accurately than our competitors.  Ryan received a BS in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science where he helped teach both the grad-level Deep Learning course and the grad-level Search Engines course.

I'm Ryan from Mineflow. Quick backstory: I've always been fascinated by how mining companies discover deposits. That passion led me to leave Google after two years of working on deep learning for ads to start Mineflow. I\u2019m convinced that mineral exploration is as much a statistics problem as it is a geology problem, and early feedback from lithium mining companies suggests I might be on the right track! The problem Accurately predicting deposit shapes is critical for geologists because each drill hole can cost tens of thousands of dollars. However, traditional computational models fall short because they:  Can't incorporate highly multimodal data Don\u2019t learn from data across multiple exploration sites Rely on naive algorithms for their inferences  As a result, mining companies often drill thousands of holes before an exploration site becomes operational, driving up costs. The solution Mineflow lets geologists upload any dataset from their exploration sites. Then, Mineflow builds a custom AI model to predict the shape and location of mineral deposits. By training a deep learning model on the whole dataset, Mineflow is able to make predictions with an order of magnitude of accuracy more than our competitors. As a result, Mineflow can significantly reduce the number of drill holes needed, saving mining companies millions in exploration costs. We can produce predictions in 2 dimensions (think overhead, bird' s-eye view) and 3 dimensions (think 3D grid of cubes). 3D gold deposit we are modeling:  2D prospectivity map we produced for an exploration project:  Team Ryan earned a BS in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie Mellon SCS and built ML models for the Google Display Ads optimization team for two years. While at Google, he launched products and deep learning models that generated ~$125m USD of ARR.  Ask If you know anyone in mineral exploration or oil and gas exploration, I'd love to connect with them to see how Mineflow can help. Grab space on my calendar here. YC Sign PhotoCompany PhotoHear from the foundersWhat is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?The discovery rate of economically viable mineral deposits near the earth's surface is declining each year. As the \"low-hanging fruit\" is claimed and mined, we\u2019ll increasingly need to drill deeper to retrieve critical minerals like gold, copper, and lithium. While mining companies today can afford to drill hundreds of holes to precisely model a deposit at a depth of 200 meters, the cost of drilling will rise sharply as we go deeper. This means fewer holes can be drilled, necessitating more powerful deep learning models to accurately predict the shape and location of these deeper mineral deposits. Mineflow will lead the way in developing a family of foundation models for predicting the earth's subsurface composition and structure. Ultimately, I hope every mining company will use Mineflow's models to guide their exploration with precision.

        "feasibility_analysis": "HeartByte's AI-assisted fiction writing platform presents a compelling opportunity in the Latin American market, particularly considering the region's vibrant creative culture and growing digital literacy.  However, success hinges on several factors. Market size is significant, given the large population and increasing internet penetration.  Cultural nuances are crucial; the platform needs to cater to diverse genres and writing styles prevalent in different Hispanic countries.  Economic factors must also be considered; a freemium or tiered subscription model might be necessary to cater to varying purchasing power.  Translation and localization efforts are vital for maximizing reach and ensuring user engagement across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.  Competition from existing writing platforms and the perceived value of AI assistance compared to traditional writing methods should also be carefully considered.",

After the company\u2019s dissolution in Q1\u201924, we decided to take forth our learnings to build Summed AI.  Tyler Rich (CEO): Data scientist who built insurance product recommendation systems Kevin Bao (CTO): Engineering leader in charge of platform and product teams Sherril Wang (CPO): Product manager with a deep understanding of agent, enrollee, and industry problems   Problem Selling Medicare policies is a complex and time-consuming process. Agents often spend 90 minutes or more per sale, navigating multiple 10 to 200-page documents filled with intricate insurance plan details. Under time pressure, agents might recommend suboptimal plans, leading to adverse medical and financial outcomes for clients. These missteps can result in chargebacks, lengthy compliance audits, or even the loss of an agent\u2019s or brokerage\u2019s license. Solution \u2022 Best-in-Market Data: We assemble comprehensive datasets and generate benefit details from policy documents on demand. \u2022 AI Assistance: Our AI helps agents perform complex plan-benefit analyses tailored to each client\u2019s needs. \u2022 Compliance Support: We walk agents step-by-step through a compliant enrollment.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Summed AI faces significant challenges adapting to the Latin American market.  The Medicare-focused nature of the product severely limits its applicability.  Medicare, as a US government program, doesn't exist in Latin America.  The solution would require a complete pivot to focus on local health insurance systems, which vary greatly across countries.  This necessitates understanding diverse regulatory landscapes, local insurance product complexities, and cultural nuances in communicating with insurance agents.  Market size analysis would need to be conducted on a country-by-country basis,  considering the penetration of private health insurance, the digital maturity of insurance agents, and the overall economic capacity for technology adoption.  Economic factors, including purchasing power and willingness to pay for AI-assisted tools within the insurance sector, must be carefully assessed.",

The MVP should involve adapting the AI to analyze a specific type of local health insurance policy, focusing on a limited set of features. This would involve securing partnerships with local insurance providers to gain access to relevant policy data and collaborating with agents for user testing. The initial MVP could focus on simplifying a critical aspect of the sales process, such as plan comparison or compliance checking, rather than trying to replicate the full functionality of the original Medicare-focused product.  Thorough market research and feedback loops with target users would be crucial during this MVP phase."

        "feasibility_analysis": "Pipeshift's platform addresses a real need: streamlining the complex process of fine-tuning and deploying open-source LLMs.  However, the Latin American market presents unique challenges. While the adoption of AI is growing, the widespread use of advanced technologies like LLMs among engineering teams is still nascent compared to the US.  Many companies in the region may lack the resources or expertise to fully utilize such a sophisticated platform.  Success hinges on targeting specific niches within the larger LATAM market, starting with larger companies in more technologically advanced countries (e.g., Mexico, Brazil, Colombia) that have in-house AI expertise or the budget to acquire it.  A crucial aspect is emphasizing cost-effectiveness and ease of use, possibly offering tiered pricing plans or tailored solutions for smaller businesses. Cultural considerations involve focusing on clear, concise communication materials in Spanish and Portuguese, and providing excellent customer support in the local languages.",

Offer this MVP as a freemium service to gain early adopters and gather valuable feedback.  Prioritize integration with easily accessible cloud infrastructure options in LATAM, such as AWS or Google Cloud, that offer reasonable pricing.  The MVP should showcase the platform's ability to significantly reduce the time and effort required for LLM deployment compared to conventional methods.  Gather data on user experience, technical performance, and feature requests to iterate and improve the platform based on specific regional needs and technical constraints."

Today the suite includes apps like:  \u2022 Go links: Go links allows anyone in the org to easily name any link so team members can jump directly to the information that matters most: go/sales, go/production, go/anything-you-want. \u2022 Profiles with Personality: OrgOrg profiles are as insightful as they are delightful. They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person. \u2022 Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on \"big rock\" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually. \u2022 Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened. \u2022 All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded. \u2022 Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group. \u2022 On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly. \u2022 And more...

His first startup, Zenter (W07), was acquired by Google and became Google Slides. Wayne spent 10 years at Google building GSuite, Sign-In with Google, Google+, Applied Machine Intelligence, and more. In 2016, Wayne founded Humu, a company focused on making work better by using software and behavioral change. Humu was acquired by Perceptyx in 2023.

My first startup (Zenter YC W07), sold to Google and became Google Slides. We changed the way more than a billion people work, and I\u2019m doing it again with OrgOrg. Try it here. The Problem - There are too many SaaS pointwise solutions! Seriously. The world over-rotated to point solutions in SaaS. It\u2019s not unusual to have 20+ minor SaaS products to do various organizational chores. It\u2019s easy to see why this happened because you need different tools at different sizes, but it\u2019s also not what users want. It\u2019s expensive, annoying to manage, and none of them work together to create a better user experience. The Solution - OrgOrg! OrgOrg draws on 25 years of experience leading high-performing teams from founding to big tech. We're building a suite with all the internal SaaS tools that you need for each stage of your company. You save money, time, and they all work together nicely. For early stage companies, Go links, \u201cBig Rock\u201d Goal tracking, and branded New browser tabs (with countdowns to your next milestone \u2014 like Demo Day) are great ways to stay focused and efficient. For larger teams, add in Profiles with personality, Smart Groups (eg, add all engineers to the #eng channel & eng@ group), All Hands Q&A, and smart On-Call management to fight the problems that come with the complexity of larger teams. Our roadmap is full of high utility internal apps and tools that build on each to help you run your company better. No matter the size of your org, you can be confident that the right internal tools will be in place when you need them. Just as no one buys Google Slides alone, buying just an All-Hands Q&A product isn\u2019t enough. OrgOrg\u2019s suite offers significantly more value than the sum of the parts of existing pointwise solutions. At $5/person/month, it's easy to get started and join over 400 organizations already using OrgOrg today. Asks Want your team to move faster at every size? Sign up for OrgOrg and give it a try. Have an internal app you\u2019ve used before that you wish you could have at your company? Let me know at wayne@orgorg.us. Company PhotoHear from the foundersHow did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)OrgOrg is the culmination of 25 years of being an operator. OrgOrg is the third company I\u2019ve founded. My first, Zenter (YC S07), was acquired by Google and turned into Google Slide. I led much of the G Suite in the early days and grew the product to Google\u2019s 4th billion dollar, and billion user product. As good as Google Workspace is as an employee productivity suite, it misses the mark as an organizational productivity suite. The tooling and applications needed to run organizations is largely missing from the suite. So, when I founded my second company in 2016, Humu, I found myself having to rebuild all the internal tools I\u2019d come to rely on to run a productive organization. Things like great employee profiles, anonymous all hands Q&A software, go links, rules based groups of people, and about a dozen more tools and apps that are required run the organization were all absent from existing productivity suites. While there are point-wise solutions to solve some of these problems, it\u2019s clear organizations need a suite of them that seamlessly operate together. In much the same way as the market for the employee productivity suite of docs, sheets and slides is larger than sum of the parts, so to is the market for an organizational productivity suite that brings the best tools together in a cohesive way. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?OrgOrg is solving the problems that arise from organizational complexity, so we can all be more productive and have a bigger impact. I\u2019ve always had a passion for making work better for people. I believe working is fundamental to the human experience. We have a natural propensity to come together and build things that are bigger than what we could do by ourselves. In it\u2019s purest form, work gives us a sense of purpose and joy. However, as organizations add people and grow linearly, the complexity that comes from each addition team member grows exponentially. The added complexity of having to interact with more people causes inefficiencies in communication, reduced focus and velocity, and erodes the sense of purpose that is critical to building successful teams. These problems can be mitigated with the right tooling and technology. With the advent of AI, it\u2019s clear we are on the brink of a change in the labor market as big as the industrial revolution. But, make no mistake, work isn\u2019t going away \u2014 because humans will always find ways to work together. The companies that embrace the fundamental reasons why we work, and embrace the technology to help mitigate the challenges of working together, are going to be the ones that are successful. In 2007, with the advent of GSuite (Google Workspace), we fundamentally changed the way people work, and OrgOrg is going to do it again. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "OrgOrg presents a strong potential for the Latin American market, particularly in countries with growing tech adoption and a burgeoning startup scene.  The market size is significant, as many businesses, both large and small, face similar organizational challenges concerning productivity and communication. However, careful consideration of the following is crucial: \n\n* **Market Segmentation:** Focusing initially on larger companies in more developed Latin American economies (e.g., Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia) would be wise, given their higher likelihood of adopting SaaS solutions.  Later expansion into smaller businesses and less developed economies would require a more tailored approach. \n* **Language & Cultural Adaptation:**  The platform must be fully translated into Spanish and Portuguese, and the user interface should be adapted to reflect regional preferences and work styles. Cultural nuances in communication and collaboration need to be incorporated. \n* **Pricing:**  A tiered pricing model reflecting the purchasing power in various Latin American markets would be beneficial.  Offering competitive pricing, perhaps in local currency, is essential. \n* **Payment Gateways:** Integrating reliable and widely accepted payment gateways for the region is crucial for smooth transactions. \n* **Economic Factors:**  Economic instability in some Latin American countries might impact customer acquisition and spending habits. Strategies for managing risk and building resilience are needed.  \n* **Competition:** The existing landscape of productivity tools and SaaS must be analyzed, particularly to highlight what differentiates OrgOrg and its competitive advantage.",

Previously, I worked on kernel level optimizations for Gemini at Google, and framework level optimizations on video models at Google Research.Jackson StokesProxis\u00a0Company LaunchesProxis - the first dedicated platform for LLM distillation and servingTl;dr: Proxis is the first dedicated platform for LLM distillation and serving, unlocking production ready models at 1/10th of the cost. The Problem  Fine-tuning frontier models like GPT-4 on proprietary data is expensive, and locks customers into one external closed source model provider. These large models are 100x the price per-token of smaller Llama 3.1 models, and run nearly 10x slower. This makes them impractical to deploy at scale. Closed source model lock-in means customers can\u2019t tweak or tune their own model, or deploy on-prem for sensitive data solutions.  The Solution Model Distillation:  In model distillation, a large teacher model effectively fine tunes a smaller student model without the need for labeled or structured datasets. This \u2018condenses\u2019 large models down to the compute cost of small models. Distillation results in near-frontier model quality, with efficient performance. This means we can achieve 5x the speed at 1/10th the cost. With the release of Llama 405b in late July, open source frontier distillation became available to the public for the first time.  Growth & Market  Llama model downloads have grown 10x in the last year and are approaching 350 million downloads to date. There were 20 million downloads in the last month alone, making Llama the leading open source model family. Llama usage by token volume across major cloud service providers has more than doubled in just three months from May through July 2024 when Llama 3.1 was released. Monthly usage (token volume) of Llama grew 10x from January to July 2024 for some of the largest cloud service providers.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Proxis, a platform for LLM distillation and serving, faces significant challenges in the Latin American market. While the underlying technology is globally relevant, its market adaptability is limited by several factors.  The target audience (enterprise AI teams) is relatively small in Latin America compared to North America or Europe.  Many Latin American companies lack the technical expertise and resources to effectively utilize LLM distillation techniques, and the existing infrastructure in some regions may not support the computational demands.  Economic factors also play a crucial role; the cost savings touted by Proxis might not be enough to incentivize adoption in markets with tighter budgets. Cultural nuances are less of a direct factor, but the need for effective multilingual support (Spanish, Portuguese, etc.) and possibly localized marketing materials would be essential.",

You can command Manaflow agents in English to execute recurring tasks and manage them on a spreadsheet interface. Think of us as an AI-first Zapier alternative but with natural language and spreadsheets. Frustrated with repetitive manual tasks in your business? We\u2019ll automate them all for you. Let\u2019s chat.  \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f The Problem: Too much Excel, too much manual stuff, too much repetition Are you tired of juggling countless Excel files and manual workflows for your business? Do these workflows prevent your business from scaling up? After conducting over 250 calls, we've discovered a recurring problem: small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) rely heavily on folders of Excel files and third-party apps to manually execute their day-to-day operations, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and a huge bottleneck to scaling. For instance, in freight forwarders, operations include managing client communications, inventory oversight, and coordinating delivery schedules, most of which are done manually. These manual processes not only decelerate business growth but also heighten the risk of mistakes. Today\u2019s operation managers are blocked by a lack of technical knowledge, customization, and simplicity in current workflow automation builders. \ud83d\udca1 Introducing MANAFLOW: Automate operations workflows with AI We are building Manaflow specifically for underdog SMBs to scale like their tech-enabled, big corporation counterparts, transforming manual spreadsheet and software tasks into automated end-to-end workflows. The ideal way to execute workflows is not for a human to manually operate Excel sheets or interface with different software apps but for a human to merely click a button. AI can own end-to-end technical workflows and convert them into features, while humans can oversee them, update them as the business evolves, and tackle higher-level automations.\u00a0Let\u2019s see this in action. \ud83d\udcd5 Building a Basic Workflow on Manaflow We\u2019ll begin by building a fun, basic workflow on Manaflow to send payment reminders to clients via email. Manaflow Demo: Building Sending Payment Reminders Workflow   Next, we\u2019ll go into more specific examples of potential use cases for business customers. \ud83d\udcf8 Manaflow Workflow #1: Watermark videos and send them to your clients via Gmail One of our customers uses Manaflow to take in unpolished videos from Google Drive, process them, watermark them with their logo, and then email the final products to their clients \u2014 all in one click of a button. Manaflow Demo: Watermarking Video Workflow   This has cut their 20-hour weekly manual workflow down to 20 minutes, and Manaflow has become a core part of their operations. \ud83d\udefb Manaflow Workflow #2: Find and email truckers for your shipment logistics Another customer uses Manaflow to find and email local trucking companies based on the shipment origin and final destination. Manaflow Demo: Finding Truckers for Logistics Workflow   This has allowed them to gather rate quotations faster for their clients and has reduced their manual operations by over 50%. \ud83d\ude4c One more thing: Collaborate with all stakeholders, including us, to build automations There are countless workflow automations that you can build on Manaflow. We understand that people have many different ideas and love working in teams. So, we made real-time collaboration so all of you can build and automate workflows together on Manaflow.

I love building tools that solve real problems, at Tesla I increased the rate at which we could build prototypes by 10x, at our company atopile we are making tools to bring the speed of software development to hardware engineering.Narayan Powderlyatopile\u00a0Company Launchesatopile - a new language to design electronic circuit boards with codeHi Everyone, we are Matt, Narayan, and Tim and we are building a new programming language to automate hardware design. TLDR; atopile is a new language + toolchain to design electronic circuit boards with code. By using code instead of graphical user interfaces, we finally bring design reuse, version control, and automation to hardware design.  Our ask \ud83d\udce3  If you love programming, git, and electronics, try using atopile to design your next circuit board If you know firmware engineers, test teams, validation teams or people who need to create lots of high-quality repetitive designs quickly - please introduce us.  The problem We love designing hardware. But existing design tools are slowing us down. The key reason is that in hardware design, everything is done manually: Electronic schematics are drawn by hand, files are exported through a series of clicks, and circuit boards are validated for weeks on the test bench. When systems become complex, this process becomes hugely time-consuming and error-prone. Imagine writing an entire complex software program using only assembly code. This is what designing hardware feels like today. The solution  atopile is a new programming language to describe electronics with code. Instead of drawing the product itself, you can now capture your product requirements using atopile source code. From there, our compiler builds and validates the product manufacturing files for you. Not only is this faster and more reliable but it also lets you use advanced software development tools such as code editors, git, GitHub, GitLab, Continuous Integration, and copilot to design hardware. After launching on Hacker News and getting hundreds of downloads, we have seen a glimpse of an exciting future: our users have created new designs in atopile, used GitHub for version control, shared their work on our Package Manager, and used Continuous Integration to generate their manufacturing files automatically. Our most active users have also made contributions to our codebase, which we are super thankful for! Early on, we decided to make atopile open-core. Our goal is to create a new industry standard for describing hardware. With an open-core approach, our users have guaranteed access to their code. Our plan is to generate revenue with enterprise-targeted features, in a model similar to GitLab. Our code is on GitHub here and we have up-to-date docs here. Who we are  Matt, Narayan, and Tim are life-long inventors, engineers, and now second-time founders. We have been engineers at companies including Tesla, DJI, and Lilium. We\u2019ve worked on teams including the 25-guns, created prototyping facilities under executive mandate, and led critical software projects where the daily cost-of-delay ran into the millions. The three of us met as we were building up a maker space in the Bay Area. After a few discussions, we quickly started putting together a prototype of the atopile compiler. We knew this had the potential to change hardware design after we compiled our first electronic printed circuit board. \u2709\ufe0f We are excited for the adventure ahead!

Most dental appointments are scheduled over the phone by overworked receptionists who put patients on hold and miss a third of incoming calls. This costs clinics a 15% loss in revenue.  Private equity investment fueled large dental groups to acquire thousands of clinics in the past few years. We are selling to these groups, since their clinics have a standardized tech stack. They\u2019re also growing really fast - in just two years they will make up 40% of the US dental market.

We\u2019re Abdul Jamjoom and Rami Rustom from Arini. tl;dr Arini is an AI receptionist for dental clinics that answers phone calls, and schedules appointments. The dental front desk is stretched thin, spending 80% of their time on the phone, yet still missing 35% of calls. Missed calls = missed revenue. Arini answers 100% of calls, 24/7. Problem Healthcare in the US is facing a massive staffing shortage, especially since COVID. It\u2019s hard for clinics to find, train, and retain admin staff. As a result, the front desk is overworked and understaffed. The dental front desk spends 6 hours a day on the phone but still misses 35% of calls. Each missed call is missed revenue. Even though 80% of dental clinics have online scheduling forms, most appointments are still booked over the phone. Even if you book online, they\u2019re going to call you back (go ahead and try it). Solution We built an AI voice agent that answers phone calls and books appointments. We plug into the existing software that dental clinics use and populate appointments on their calendar. We can also answer questions about insurance, billing, and anything else the patient needs. We help practices increase revenue by booking more appointments. We also help them reduce their operating cost since they need to recruit, train, and retain fewer receptionists. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzscKs5cxwc   The team and how we landed on dental We met in high school in Jordan, co-founded a start-up 2 years ago, and are always hacking together.

Rami studied CS at MIT and joined Threads a year ago, and we both led Threads\u2019 AI team, where we automated customer support, document feedback, notification triaging, and more. We landed on the dental space after going door-to-door to dentists, shadowing them, and experiencing first-hand the challenges they faced. It was clear that the front desk was a bottleneck for increasing bookings, even though dentists in the US spend $7B a year on front desk staffing.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Adapting Cleva's USD banking platform for the Hispanic Latin American market presents both opportunities and challenges.  The market size is significant, with a growing number of freelancers and businesses engaging in international transactions. However, the financial landscape varies considerably across countries, with differing levels of financial inclusion and technological infrastructure.  Cultural nuances must be considered in marketing and user interface design to ensure local relevance. Economic factors such as inflation and currency volatility, which Cleva aims to mitigate, are prevalent in several Latin American countries, presenting a strong value proposition.  A key challenge will be navigating the regulatory environment for financial services in each target country.  Furthermore, establishing trust and building brand awareness will require strategic marketing efforts tailored to each specific market.",

The target market for a sophisticated business intelligence tool like Buster is likely limited to larger corporations and organizations with established data analytics departments, which are less prevalent in the region compared to North America or Europe.  Furthermore, the reliance on English language proficiency for effective usage presents a barrier to entry.  While Spanish-language support could be added,  training and adoption would require considerable effort.

We\u2019re on a mission to enable everyone to create, share, and enjoy the magic of AI-generated videos with consistent characters. Check out the most popular video made with Eggnog - it got 100k views on Twitter in 24 hours! Paul Graham even said it was funny!   AI Videos don\u2019t have consistent characters AI videos exploded in the past year, and we saw a deluge of content that was funny, spooky, and whimsical. But one thing has held these videos back from really being ready for primetime \u2013 AI video creators can\u2019t create scenes with consistent characters. Creators try every trick in the book to give their wizard the same wizened face from one scene to the next, but no matter, the wizard always looks different. Inconsistent characters kill so much of the magic of AI videos. It\u2019s hard to get invested in the protagonist of a story if they look different in every scene! Eggnog Eggnog gives creators the control to design their characters exactly how they imagine and lets them use those characters in cinematic scenes. This unlocks AI video creation that is immersive with characters that viewers get attached to. Creators can also use and remix characters made by other Eggnog users, allowing creators to build worlds in a collaborative and social way. We use a special mix of open-source diffusion models and post-processing to give creators control. Until now, the average creator couldn\u2019t make a truly cinematic scene without a Hollywood budget for actors, sets, cameras, etc. Scenes from Interstellar, Dune, and Jurassic World were impossible to make without millions of dollars and months of time. But Eggnog changes that.  What\u2019s next? Character consistency is the foundation of entertaining AI video, but it\u2019s only the beginning. We\u2019re excited about a future where users can remix characters and scenes to build infinite storylines. We\u2019re going to make it possible for viewers to get engrossed in a cinematic universe and then expand on that universe in a collaborative and social way.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Eggnog presents a compelling opportunity within the rapidly expanding AI video generation space.  The focus on consistent characters addresses a significant limitation of current AI video tools, enhancing storytelling potential.  However, the Latin American market presents unique challenges. While there's growing internet penetration and smartphone usage, infrastructure limitations (especially in some regions) might impact video upload and streaming speeds.  The target audience will likely skew towards younger, tech-savvy demographics in urban areas initially.  Cultural nuances in storytelling and humor need consideration when tailoring content.  Monetization strategies should be carefully assessed, balancing subscription models with potential free tiers to appeal to a broader audience with varying disposable incomes.  The relatively high cost of AI processing power will need to be considered in terms of scaling and pricing.",

For example, we intervene and stop when someone pastes a code snippet that contains a secret key into ChatGPT while troubleshooting. The problem  AI faces enterprise adoption roadblocks: Despite Gen AI boosting productivity, many enterprises remain wary. Even in 2024, over 1 in 4 organizations have banned all AI apps, keeping them off-limits to employees. AI app sprawl: There are now well over 1,000 Gen AI apps, and many have questionable security practices. These cool \u201ctools\u201d continue to worry CSOs (Chief Security Officers) as employees are already using many of these to get work done. Data privacy remains a top concern: Over 55% of all prompts contain some form of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This is not only a privacy nightmare, but also pushes enterprises out of compliance with multiple regulations such as PCI, SOX and HIPAA.  Our solution   AI app discovery: We discover and catalog all AI apps in use by employees and help security teams understand the risk levels of each of these apps.    Granular application access policies: Rather than block all apps by default, we allow enterprises to allow some trustworthy AI apps and steer users towards those. For example, if your org invested in Chat GPT enterprise, we help get the most out of that investment by encouraging people to use that instead of a random cool file summarizer on the internet.    Protect data leakage: On the allowed AI apps, Unbound monitors all prompts and also blocks users from sharing sensitive information based on the configured AI usage policy.    Our ask and offer  If you know a company that has blocked the usage of AI apps, we can help your friends use these apps with IT consent. Please drop us a note at founders@unboundsecurity.ai. If you\u2019d like to understand what people are using AI for within your org, and stay compliant, we are happy to offer our AI visibility platform for free to any YC company.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Unbound Security's solution addresses a significant concern for Latin American businesses: data security in the age of generative AI.  The market size is substantial, as larger companies in the region are increasingly adopting AI tools, mirroring global trends.  However, the implementation needs careful consideration of varying levels of digital maturity across different countries. Smaller businesses might not have the resources or expertise to fully utilize Unbound's advanced features, while larger enterprises in more developed economies like those in Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay) are more likely to adopt such a solution.  Cultural nuances regarding data privacy and regulations (which vary across Latin American nations) must be carefully addressed. Economic factors are also relevant, as pricing and sales strategies must align with the financial capabilities of potential clients in the region.

While the core concept of automating B2B sales processes is universally applicable, the implementation faces hurdles.  Market penetration requires careful consideration of varying levels of digital adoption across different Hispanic countries.  Many wholesalers, especially smaller ones, may lack the technological infrastructure or the digital literacy to adopt AI-powered solutions.  The economic landscape also plays a crucial role; convincing businesses to switch from established, albeit manual, processes to a new software solution requires a compelling value proposition, especially considering potential costs and integration challenges with existing ERP systems.  Cultural nuances in business communication and payment preferences need to be carefully integrated into the AI agents' design.

These contractors currently sit in the 95th percentile of earners in their country \u2014 but their financial infrastructure is unstable. It's fragmented across PEOs, gig marketplaces, and consumer remittance platforms. With their local currency weakening against the US Dollar, they need control on how and when to repatriate funds. They don't just need a remittance app. They need a bank.  Numo provides international contractors with a US bank account \u2014 and instant, low-cost payment rails to move money home. This way they can hold funds in USD up to the second they need to spend it.

When they need to spend it, we transfer money instantly to their local bank account. We launched last week, and have 105 contractors already live and onboarded on Numo, sending their first invoices.  Problem Paying international contractors for short-term engagements is messy. It\u2019s full of remittance services whose brands are not conducive to trust or a professional environment and often look fraudulent to the uninformed.   For contractors, it\u2019s even messier. With expensive fees, slow transfer times, and fuzzy tax + compliance rules \u2014 we\u2019ve seen our customers resort to funneling money through friends and families just to get paid.   And the death blow for contractors is the hyperinflation many of their home currencies are experiencing. Contractors work more every day for less money. International contractors want to hold their funds in USD as long as they can, and then bring it back only when they need to spend.  Solution So we built Numo:   Contractors can onboard and get verified, background checked, and launch their profiles.    Every invoice they send via Numo to their clients is paired with their verified profile.    Their American clients get to pay the way they are most comfortable: ACH payment to a US bank account.    Contractors can hold the USD they make stateside until the moment they need to spend it locally. They can transfer funds to their local account within 20 seconds without excessive fees.

Happier clinicians, better care.Confronting Healthcare's Staffing Crisis The American healthcare system faces a daunting challenge: clinician burnout has soared to its highest levels since the pandemic, and aging baby boomers are ballooning the demand for healthcare services. This strain is leading to a critical shortfall in clinicians, jeopardizing patient care quality. Hospitals are now grappling with not only how to retain their workforce but also how to ensure patient loyalty in an increasingly competitive landscape. The heart of the issue lies in the nature of clinicians' workloads, which include a significant amount of administrative, rules-based tasks ripe for automation. As a result, administrative automation has emerged as the top strategic priority for hospitals and insurers in 2024. Anaphero is building goal-oriented AI agents to expand clinical capacity Anaphero addresses healthcare staffing shortages by automating routine but essential tasks. We enable health systems to deploy custom AI agents that interact with patients through text, voice, or video, emulating human clinicians. Our AI agents can answer questions, collect information, and interface with electronic health records. We've built our platform with safety at its core, incorporating proactive bias assessments, continuous risk monitoring, and clinician oversight to maintain high standards of care. Our clinical agents can safely do a lot of the work that keeps healthcare running smoothly. This not only increases clinical capacity but also allows doctors and nurses to concentrate on what they find most rewarding\u2014making clinical decisions and counseling patients. The outcome is a workforce of more satisfied clinicians, improved care quality, and more loyal patients.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Intryc's AI-powered QA solution for customer support presents a significant opportunity in Latin America, but requires careful consideration.  The market size is substantial, as many large and medium-sized enterprises across various sectors (banking, utilities, e-commerce) in Hispanic countries handle a large volume of customer interactions. However, the adoption of AI-driven solutions varies across the region, with some countries showing higher technological maturity than others.  Cultural nuances play a role; language support beyond Spanish (considering regional dialects) is crucial for broad adoption. Economic factors, such as budget constraints and the willingness to invest in advanced technologies, need to be carefully assessed during market entry.  A phased approach, targeting specific countries or sectors initially, would be advisable, starting with those exhibiting higher digitalization and a strong need for improved customer service efficiency. Furthermore, the pricing model must be flexible to cater to businesses of different sizes and levels of resources.",

Start by partnering with 2-3 medium-sized companies in a single country (e.g., Mexico, Colombia, or Chile) with established customer support operations.  Integrate with a commonly used help desk platform in the region (e.g., Zendesk, Salesforce Service Cloud).  The MVP should focus on a core set of features:  Automated sampling of customer interactions, AI-based evaluation based on pre-defined scorecards (initially focusing on key metrics like response time and politeness), and basic reporting on agent performance. This phased approach allows for iterative improvements based on early user feedback, refining both the AI model and user interface to better suit the local context before scaling to other countries and larger enterprises."

Bucket Robotics is making defect detection faster and easier to deploy to prevent that.  Our products are designed to be easy to integrate into existing automation and technology stacks, flexible enough to bring retooling costs down, and reliable enough to make you forget that it's a robot.  Matt and Steph are leveraging their experience from the self-driving industry, where we've integrated high-performance computing and quality sensing into complex, noise-filled environments. We focus on robust hardware and user-friendly software for a new generation of end-users, ensuring ease of use and rapid deployment.  Secure and efficient handling of user data can make customers in the manufacturing space nervous to invest in sensing \u2014 our team's extensive experience handling self-driving car data in these regulated environments positions us uniquely to tackle these challenges. Companies like Keyence, National Instruments, and FLIR offer either outdated hardware or prohibitively expensive systems, along with software that hasn\u2019t evolved to meet modern user needs.  US manufacturing is undergoing a significant transformation, with construction spending hitting a record annualized pace of over $200 billion. The need for a more reliable supply chain has seen over $700 billion in manufacturing megaprojects across North America since 2021, and this growth requires heavy automation. Bucket Robotics is at the forefront of this shift, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution that enhances automation and positions manufacturers closer to their end customers.Bucket RoboticsFounded:2024Team Size:2Location:Pittsburgh, PAGroup Partner:Diana Hu\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersMatt Puchalski, Founder/CEOMatt is co-founder and CEO of Bucket Robotics.

CAD goes in \u2014 detection model comes out.  \ud83d\udc65 The Team Hi everyone, we\u2019re Matt and Steph, and we\u2019re Bucket Robotics!  \ud83d\udcc9 The Problem Defects are a universal challenge in manufacturing, particularly with methods like injection molding, die casting, and 3D printing. Factories using these methods frequently retool their lines for different products making it difficult and costly to gather enough data to train defect detection models. Manufacturers strive to ensure that only the highest quality products reach their customers. Avoiding the shipment of defective products not only protects their reputation but also safeguards expensive machinery from damage, maximizes yield by leveraging advanced analytics, and prevents the progression of faulty parts through the production line, which can lead to compounded waste and increased costs. A 2017 study estimates that\u00a0yield losses account for 44% of sheet metal used\u00a0in the production of passenger vehicles \u2014 and we want to bring that number down, saving money and the environment. Traditionally, defect detection comes in two flavors:  Pay a person to watch your line. Train a vision model the old-fashioned way \u2014 wait for defective parts to come out and add your sample to the dataset.  Paying people to check parts is inefficient and a miserable job. Collecting enough labeled data samples to train a model is impractical for rapidly retooled outputs, and the labeling is expensive. This often leaves manufacturers with a critical gap in quality assurance, leading to increased scrap, downtime, and potentially unhappy customers with defective parts. \ud83d\udcc8\u00a0The Solution We help eliminate the need for inefficient human monitoring and outdated defect detection by providing a system where we generate defect detection models using CAD files\u2014something every part designed for modern manufacturing has. Our models can run on an edge computing device as small as a Jetson Orin Nano and be continually refined with real-world data. Here\u2019s why this is a game-changer:  Early Deployment:\u00a0Your defect detector can arrive at your manufacturing line before you\u2019ve manufactured any parts. This means you can catch defects right from the get-go. Continuous Improvement:\u00a0As defects start to appear, we can automatically refine and improve the model, ensuring your system remains top-notch. Classification: The system tells you how the part is defective, allowing you to dial in your tooling configuration and maintenance cycle\u2014e.g. when it's time to create a new mold.

He often struggles to complete work due to his tendency to hyper-focus on details and get distracted by sudden impulses. Here is what Jeff's new workflow looks like since he started using FocusBuddy: Jeff calls Focus Buddy first thing in the morning after breakfast. They go over his to-do list together and create a schedule for his day. Jeff then begins his first task - writing a draft PRD. He explains his approach to FocusBuddy and asks for frequent check-ins to keep him on track. An hour into drafting, Jeff notices a small discrepancy in a user activity chart. His ADHD brain latches onto this detail, and he spends the next 30 minutes hyper-focusing on it, losing sight of the bigger picture. Just then, FocusBuddy speaks up: \"How's it going?\" Jeff explains: \"He is still figuring out the details on the chart\" FocusBuddy detects that Jeff has been hyper-focusing on a detail and helps Jeff realize that he is falling behind on schedule with more important parts of the PRD. Focus Buddy then works with Jeff to wrap up work on the chart discrepancy and reorganize his schedule to come back to the chart later in the day. They then do a 5-minute meditation to shift his focus away from the discrepancy and ease his mind back onto the main task. At the end of the day, FocusBuddy helps Jeff perform a daily reflection and prepare for his day tomorrow. Jeff and our other users experience multiple types of interventions by Focus Buddy every single day and attribute their new-found productivity to it. Why Focus Buddy works Today, people with ADHD spend hours every day virtually co-working on apps like Focusmate, updating to-do lists, using meditation apps like Calm, and journaling with little success. It is extremely hard to keep these apps updated, they have very little context about you and are unable to proactively provide timely support when needed. Focus Buddy is deeply integrated, is seamless to interact with, builds a lot of context over time and is able to leverage this context at critical moments to provide the necessary support. On top of that, our voice AI infrastructure is revolutionising the way humans and AI interact. we're crafting an entirely new paradigm for fluid, natural conversations that feel as intuitive as talking to another person.

Andy completes clinical documentation for nurses doing home health visits. What is home health? Skilled nursing in the home is a booming business, on track to double to $250B in by 2031. Better outcomes, lower costs, and aligned with patient preferences: it\u2019s no surprise large insurers are scooping up home health providers.  The problem: too much charting On the ground, however, we\u2019re seeing widespread burnout among nurses. The worst part of the job is documentation, which can take 90 minutes for a single patient and costs agencies $8B per year. Agencies that employ these nurses struggle to submit\u00a0high-quality\u00a0documentation in a\u00a0timely\u00a0manner, which is hurting their top line. The solution: an AI scribe Andy is an AI-powered ambient scribe designed specifically for home health nurses. Nurses record their visits using their Andy app and receive a chart completed by Andy straight into their EHR. With Andy, the 90-minute documentation process is now a 15-minute review.

We help eCommerce merchants personalize their sales to generate additional revenue and profit.  Ecommerce merchants and marketers typically use discounts to drive customer acquisition, boost sales during holidays, or liquidate inventory. But deciding on a discount to offer is typically guesswork. Who to send the discount to, how much to offer, and which products it applies to are, in the most advanced cases, determined manually by looking at past sales and seeing what worked well. In the majority of cases, it's what feels and sounds good.  Promi leverages store data to optimize discounts at a more granular level than possible manually. We dynamically determine the best value across each product, for different users, at different times in order to maximize sales and profit.Latest News13 companies from YC Demo Day 1 that are worth paying attention to | TechCrunchSep 25, 2024Jobs at PromiView all jobs \u2192Founding EngineerSan Francisco, CA, US / Sunnyvale, CA, US$100K - $150K1.00% - 2.00%1+ yearsApply NowPromiFounded:2024Team Size:2Location:Group Partner:Dalton Caldwell\u00a0Active FoundersPeter Moot, FounderCo-founder @ Promi, a pricing and discount optimization platform.

Jiaxin: The AI mastermind Jiaxin was the tech lead and founding engineer at Uber\u2019s knowledge graph platform, focusing on recommendations and personalization. Before Uber, Jiaxin worked in AI at Google\u2019s Shopping Recommendations team. \u274c The Problem Most retailers spend 5-10% of their gross merchandise value on discounts to acquire new customers, celebrate holidays, hit sales targets, clear inventory, etc. However, choosing the right discount often involves guesswork. More sophisticated merchants look at what worked well in the past, but they don\u2019t have the time or means to granularly optimize their discounts across products and users, or dynamically update the offers based on order trends. Additionally, many retailers don\u2019t communicate savings available via discount codes on their website until checkout, causing a drop in customer conversion. \ud83d\udca1 Our Solution Promi enhances discount performance by addressing key issues:  Dynamic Updates: AI-driven adjustments ensure efficient inventory clearance without over-discounting. Specify the volume, timeframe, and pricing guardrails, and Promi will continuously monitor and update discounts.

Apps are leveraging this new hardware to ship on-device AI/ML across a range of use cases, from creative tooling (e.g. image editing) to video conferencing to copilots for warehouse workers. On-device inference is important for apps/features requiring low latency, privacy/security, offline functionality, and zero server costs. \u274c The Problem Developing effective on-device AI/ML is finicky and time-consuming. You have to convert Python models to on-device formats. Then, you have to optimize models across end-user devices (with varying capabilities), benchmark them on physical devices, and evaluate performance-quality trade-offs\u2026 in a highly iterative development cycle. Each phase of this dev cycle requires tedious work, like figuring out appropriate model optimizations across different devices.

        "feasibility_analysis": "BiteSight's video-first approach to food delivery presents a compelling opportunity in the Latin American market.  The market is large and growing, with a significant portion of the population increasingly using smartphones and engaging with online platforms for food ordering. However, success hinges on several factors.  Cultural adaptation is crucial \u2013 video content needs to resonate with local tastes and preferences, considering the diverse culinary landscape across Hispanic countries. Economic factors also play a role; pricing strategies must be competitive and accessible to various income levels.  Infrastructure challenges in certain regions could affect delivery times and app performance.  Language localization and payment gateway integration for various local methods are essential.  Competition from established players like Rappi and Uber Eats will be intense, requiring a strong marketing strategy focused on highlighting the unique video-driven experience and personalized recommendations.",

Develop the app in Spanish, integrating popular local payment gateways. Partner with a smaller selection of diverse restaurants initially, focusing on high-quality video production of their most popular dishes. Leverage social media marketing targeted at foodies and young adults in the chosen city, using influencer collaborations to build awareness and drive initial orders.  The MVP should focus on the core functionality: video browsing, ordering, and delivery, with personalized recommendations added in later iterations.  Gather user feedback extensively to inform subsequent development, prioritizing features based on user preferences and identifying any needed cultural adaptations."

We\u2019re Ros and Kathleen of Adagy Robotics, and we\u2019re here to rescue your robots! \ud83d\udde3\ufe0fTL;DR: Adagy is a remote intervention service for robots Our Ask  \ud83e\udd16 If you\u2019re at a robotics company or a robotics integrator: schedule a demo with us, or let us know why you wouldn\u2019t! founders@adagyrobotics.com \ud83e\udd1d If you know people in robotics, robotic integration, logistics or manufacturing companies: we\u2019d like warm intros for anyone who works at a robotics company, a company that does automation integration, or anyone who works with robots in logistics or manufacturing.   The Problem \ud83d\ude33 We love robots, but they fail often. For example, a robot might get stuck in tall grass because it interprets the grass in the same way it might interpret a chain link fence \u2013 catastrophically impenetrable! This problem is painful for end users \u2013 a farmer who has just spent $100k on an autonomous tractor doesn\u2019t want to stop work to tell the robot \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f \u201cthat\u2019s not a fence\u201d \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f every 4 hours. This problem is painful for robotics companies \u2013 they want to be able to sell robots that work, but it can take many years of R&D to get to 99.999% reliability. Robotics companies are used to getting angry calls from customers \u2013 or worse, selling a robot that collects dust because it\u2019s too unreliable. The Solution \ud83d\udc40 Adagy Robotics is a 24/7 remote intervention service for your robots. When your robot fails, it can call out to Adagy over our API. Our trained operators will take over and drive your robot back to a stable state, and then resume autonomous operation. With Adagy, customers won\u2019t even notice that a robot has failed, but robotics companies will be able to learn from the data collected during those failures. With a safeguard like Adagy in place, robotics companies can deploy and scale robots earlier. Safety and trust are at the core of our business:  We notify site staff before taking control of the robot. We provide incident reports after each rescue. We maintain an auditable log of all failures and the actions taken by our operators. We proactively highlight repeat failures.  Initially, we'll be doing all interventions manually.\u00a0 In the future we will layer in our own ML models to help the human drivers be more efficient and accurate, to do predictive failure prevention, and offer a software-only \u2018supervisor\u2019 to our customers.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Adagy's remote robot rescue service presents a unique opportunity in Latin America, but requires careful consideration. The market size depends heavily on the adoption rate of robotics in agriculture, manufacturing, and logistics within Spanish-speaking countries.  While large-scale robotic deployment is less prevalent than in developed nations, there's growing interest.  Cultural nuances are important; building trust with both robot owners and operators is crucial, emphasizing safety and transparency. Economic factors play a role \u2013 pricing must be competitive while ensuring profitability, considering the varying economic conditions across different Latin American countries.  A tiered pricing model catering to different-sized businesses might be beneficial. The initial focus should be on sectors with higher robot adoption and potentially start with a pilot program in a specific country before scaling.",

Contracts are separately issued by governments, and responses must meet long lists of criteria to be compliant and award-eligible, making them immensely hard and time-consuming to write. Hazel breaks down that moat. If you or anyone you know wants to get matched to or respond to government RFPs, please contact us! \ud83e\udd77 About Us We\u2019re Elton and August, in SF for this YC W24 batch. We\u2019re excited to announce Hazel, an AI-driven marketplace that enables businesses to quickly respond to issued government RFPs in a compliant manner.  The two of us met in college before taking separate jobs at Palantir and Boston Consulting Group \u2013 but our focus on mission and serving the public interest remained the same, and we saw something that we knew had to be fixed. \ud83d\udcc4 Problem The government contracting process is broken. Contracts are separately posted on thousands of different websites and can include hundreds of pages of overlapping compliance regulations. Responding to bids can require entire business divisions supported by armies of consultants and in-house lawyers. Even the simplest of contracts \u2013 if you can find one that fits your business \u2013 require responses spanning dozens of pages, and the tiniest compliance error will jeopardize your entire submission. The US has created a system where it is almost impossible for SMBs to win work with the government. As incumbents become even more entrenched, governments face increasing prices and deteriorating performance because they have allowed for no alternatives. With over $1T of infrastructure funding now on the line for award, the US cannot afford the status quo. \ud83e\udde0 Solution Use AI to automate discovery, drafting, and compliance. Instead of spending days trawling local websites and weeks writing fruitless proposals, you should only spend minutes defining your scope of work and price. Use Hazel to get matched to a potential contract, synthesize a draft response based on the RFP and your company information, create a checklist of to-dos, and run compliance checks. No more scrambling to register your company the day before submission. No more losing a bid because you missed a cybersecurity requirement listed on page 13 of Appendix G.  {Choose which sections to include in your response, view a timeline of the next steps for the process, and use GenAI to craft your answer based on existing company documentation.} \ud83d\udcc8 Asks  Reach out!

We started Lantern because we believe AI is going to impact every single enterprise in every single industry. We want to allow every company to tap into their unstructured data to build better applications.  With Lantern Cloud, developers have access to everything they need to build an AI application: embedding generation, vector compression, vector search, efficient indexing, and more. All on top of the database they already know, Postgres, and using infrastructure that scales to billions.  Check out our code on Github: https://github.com/lanterndata/lanternLatest NewsYC\u2019s latest Demo Day shows fascinating wagers on healthcare, chip design, AI and more | TechCrunchApr 04, 2024LanternFounded:2023Team Size:3Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Gustaf Alstromer\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersDi Qi, FounderI'm working on Lantern.

I was an early engineer at Timescale, a billion-dollar Postgres company, where I contributed core features.  I did my undergrad at Princeton, where I built a safe OS schedule in Rust for my thesis. More recently, I was a PhD Student at UC Berkeley working on distributed systems.Narek GalstyanLantern\u00a0Company LaunchesLantern - Postgres vector database \ud83c\udfeeHi! We\u2019re Di and Narek. We\u2019re building\u00a0Lantern. About Lantern Lantern is a Postgres vector database that is easy to use, cost-effective, and scales to billions. Anyone using a standalone vector database such as Pinecone has to maintain a separate database for their other application needs. This adds complexity. With Lantern, you can run vector search in the database you already know and love, Postgres. In addition, Lantern is orders of magnitude cheaper than Pinecone. We recently released product quantization. This enables index compression so the index can use up to 90% less memory and cost an additional 90% less! We support embedding generation with Open AI, Cohere, and open-source embedding models inside the database for one-off queries. For bulk transactions and managed columns, we support generating up to 2 million embeddings per hour.  We also support external index creation, which offloads index creation to external machines to avoid expensive index creation processes causing downtime in production databases. Get Started The easiest way to get started is with Lantern Cloud, our managed Postgres service. To self-host or explore our source code, check out our GitHub repo. If you are currently using another vector database provider or another Postgres provider, we have tools to make migration seamless. We have multiple customers using Lantern in production, and we\u2019d love to have you give us a try too! We\u2019re happy to answer any questions or help you get set up - reach out at support@lantern.dev or on X at @diqitally.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Lantern, a Postgres vector database extension for AI applications, faces challenges in the Latin American market. While the demand for AI solutions is growing, the target audience (developers) is relatively smaller compared to other markets.  The high technical expertise required to implement and utilize Lantern might limit adoption, especially considering varying levels of technological infrastructure across different Latin American countries.  Economic factors also play a role; the cost-effectiveness compared to competitors needs to be strongly emphasized, as many companies may prioritize affordability over advanced features.  Cultural nuances regarding technology adoption and preference for specific database solutions will need to be carefully considered during marketing and outreach.",

The good news is that Duty Drawback\u2014a tax refund program\u2014lets companies reclaim that cash! Astonishingly, $10 billion (80% of eligible refunds) goes unclaimed each year. Why? The process is a real headache. Today, dealing with the government and customs brokerages takes months, as they take 10-20% of the refund and refuse to work on claims under $100k. As a result, only large enterprises file drawbacks, leaving smaller businesses out in the cold.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Pax AI's AI-powered import tax refund solution presents a significant opportunity in Latin America.  The large volume of imports and exports across the region, coupled with complexities in customs procedures, creates a substantial market for streamlining the duty drawback process. However, the feasibility hinges on several factors:  \n\n* **Market Size:** While the US market is large, the Latin American market may be fragmented and vary significantly across countries due to differing import/export regulations and digital literacy levels.  Careful market segmentation and prioritization of specific countries with higher import volumes and better digital infrastructure would be crucial. \n* **Cultural Nuances:**  Building trust and navigating bureaucracy differs across Latin American nations.  A localized approach involving partnerships with trusted local entities (accounting firms, logistics providers) would be essential to overcome cultural barriers and build confidence among businesses. Language localization is mandatory. \n* **Economic Factors:** The economic stability and digital maturity of target countries will significantly impact adoption rates.  Offering flexible pricing models tailored to different business sizes and considering payment options that align with local practices (e.g., installment plans) would boost adoption.  \n* **Regulatory Landscape:**  Import/export regulations vary significantly across countries in Latin America.  Pax needs to be adaptable to these variations, possibly requiring country-specific versions or integrations.\n\nOverall, Pax has high potential but needs a phased approach focusing on a few key markets initially.",

Masters in CS/AI from Cornell. Always game to chat anything dev tools, OSS, AI Architecture!Gabe RuttnerHatchet\u00a0Company LaunchesHatchet - Background task orchestration and visibility platformtl;dr - At a certain scale, all applications need a task queue - think Celery for Python, BullMQ for Node.js, and Sidekiq for Rails. Hatchet is an open-source, managed task queue focused on scale, reliability, and improved developer experience. https://youtu.be/3myPYVyaqwM   The problem Building a reliable application is difficult \u2014 network connections can fail or be interrupted, the application could run out of memory, or a bad commit on production can take down your entire service. To reduce the pressure on APIs, task queues are typically used to offload different parts of the application logic to other services in the system. However, these queues introduce more points of failure \u2014 they require new infrastructure, a new set of integrations to monitor and debug your tasks, and are difficult to use in development. As applications begin to scale, application developers are forced to implement solutions to avoid queue overflow and overcrowding and to think about how to optimize their queues. With LLM APIs \u2014 which are high latency and highly variable in response quality \u2014 these problems are even worse. It\u2019s now typical to ingest, sync, vectorize, and index the entirety of multiple data sources on account creation, and as LLM systems get more agentic, developers need to chain together unreliable LLM calls to fulfill requests. These requests are often slow and without the right architecture delivering a responsive and reliable user experience is challenging. The solution Hatchet is an end-to-end platform for task orchestration. It includes a web UI for monitoring tasks, an API for interacting with tasks and workflows, and SDKs for Python, Typescript, and Golang.  Hatchet has all the features you\u2019d expect \u2014 like retries, timeouts, and cron schedules \u2014 along with features that developers are usually asked to build, like handling different fairness and concurrency patterns, durable execution, and result streaming. The team We\u2019re both ex-CTOs and founders of multiple YC-funded companies \u2014 Alexander was co-founder and CTO at Porter (S20) while Gabe was co-founder and CTO at Clearmix (also S20). Before that, Alexander got his Master\u2019s in Physics from UPenn while Gabe got his Master\u2019s in AI from Cornell. Alexander started working on this after years of wrangling task queues and distributed systems at both Porter and Oneleet, where he experienced the issues of building complex task orchestration and workflows. Gabe came at this from another perspective, having spent the last few years working with ML and more recently LLM stacks, where he saw the architectural problems that many of these applications have. We immediately bonded over our excitement about what infrastructure will look like as AI becomes core to nearly every business.  How do I get started? Hatchet is fully open source with an invite-only cloud offering. Feel free to request access or check out the self-hosting Hatchet docs. If you\u2019re dealing with observability problems in your queue, are running batch processing of documents for LLM workflows, or are experiencing queue fairness problems in multi-tenant apps, we\u2019d love to chat.

We ingest provider information and use AI to automate submissions, saving providers months of waiting. \u274c The Problem Being in network with a health insurer is critical for both patients and providers:  For patients, seeing in network providers means dramatically lower healthcare costs. This informs which providers they choose and whether they can even afford to visit one. For providers, being in network means a bigger pool of potential patients. It also simplifies billing and reimbursement.  However, the process of getting a provider in network is highly manual and fragmented. There are approximately 1,400 payers in the US, each with their own enrollment process. Some of these processes involve painstakingly filling out 50+ page forms. On top of burning hours of administrator time, delays are costly. A single incorrect field can push back cases by months. With providers billing $3,000/week, this costs healthcare practices tens of thousands of dollars per provider. \u2b50 Our Solution We provide standardized questionnaires to collect all required provider information and documents. Our customers are then able to request a new network enrollment in just a few clicks instead of spending hours navigating insurance websites to find the correct forms.  On the backend, we\u2019re automating each part of the enrollment process. We also have an experienced ops team as humans-in-the-loop to make sure everything is processed correctly.

Central is the first payroll, benefits & ops platform designed for busy founders, not HR/finance professionals. Unlike other platforms, Central handles each compliance task from start to finish. You don\u2019t need to learn or do anything. You just keep building because that\u2019s what truly matters. Think of Central as abstracting away the government and also declarative i.e. you set your desired end state, and Central makes it happen.

We\u2019ll handle reimbursements, offer letters, NDAs, I-9 verification, and more. Automated payroll state registrations: Existing platforms make founders interface with state agencies, leading to errors & fines. Central automates this entire process resulting in accurate tax IDs and withholding rates. Automated payroll tax filings: Existing platforms cover some taxes, and leave founders to handle the rest, leading to mistakes and fines. Central pays all taxes and verifies payments with federal, state, and local agencies. Automated worker\u2019s comp: When you hire your first employee in a state, you need state-specific worker\u2019s compensation insurance. Existing platforms make you go to other platforms to get a policy, leading to missed coverage and fines. Instead, Central sets it up and ensures payment automatically. Government mail monitoring: Founders often miss important government mail due to address changes. To combat this, Central adds a virtual mailing address to all of your state filings. This virtual address stays the same when you move, so Central can notify you about government mail and take the appropriate action.  Business compliance & insurance  Foreign qualifications & city registrations: Central handles the necessary business filings & the registered agent in your HQ city/state and other states when required. Continuous BOI reporting to FinCEN: The Corporate Transparency Act requires companies to submit beneficial ownership information (BOI) reports to FinCEN. Central files this for you and keeps it updated as officers and their information change.

TL;DR: Nuanced detects AI-generated images. We help companies like dating apps, ad platforms, news sites, and marketplaces distinguish human-authored materials from AI-generated content.   We\u2019re solving the authenticity crisis No one wants to lose users because of fake AI content. Consumers lose trust in a platform flooded with AI-generated content, risking churn and reputational damage. As AI-generated content surges, distinguishing it from human-made material becomes vital for trust and authenticity. Existing detection technologies fall short, resulting in a $78B annual deepfake expense, and amplify growing problems such as misinformation and identity verification. Our solution has three parts:  Easy integration via our API. Privacy-first, custom zero PII models. Staying ahead of AI-generated threats with our dedicated research team.  With Nuanced, you\u2019ll never have to compromise user privacy, build costly internal systems, or take on complex integrations.

Check in for points and earn rewards at our 15+ partnered Bay area restaurants like Wooly Pig. Download Forge Rewards on the Apple and Google Play Stores! Hey everyone! We\u2019re Ethan and Isaac, and we\u2019re building Forge. Our journey started as roommates at Stanford where we worked on ad-branded contraceptives, AI-generated Spotify playlists, and exploring new restaurants. We dropped out and are now on a mission to enhance customer relationships and build loyalty for restaurants. The Problem In high school (post-pandemic), we saw firsthand while working at a Korean corndog shop and a mom-and-pop Chinese restaurant that local restaurants struggled with building a presence. Since then, we\u2019ve learned that local businesses and mom-and-pop restaurants face issues with driving repeat, in-person traffic - while losing 30% to third-party delivery apps. Stores needed an easy, user-friendly platform that could:  Enhance their discoverability\u00a0via a marketplace Retain customers who spend more Reclaim profitability  without having to manage an entire app by themselves. We wanted to create a network that allowed users to easily access multiple restaurants from a single app rather than downloading dozens of individual, white-labeled apps. Our Solution: Forge, the last loyalty app you\u2019ll need. Forge is a centralized platform to access loyalty programs for many restaurants and stores. We want to drive in-person traffic and have rolled out new features that encourage engagement and discovery like order-ahead (at select restaurants), a social points leaderboard, and a marketplace to connect food creators. Our vision: We see a future where restaurants form deep ties with local neighborhoods and beyond \u2014 Forge will power this communal growth.

The market size is significant, with numerous small and medium-sized restaurants (pymes) that lack dedicated loyalty programs.  However, challenges exist.  Many restaurants operate informally or with limited technological capabilities, making app integration a hurdle.  Market penetration will require strong partnerships with restaurant associations and targeted outreach to individual establishments. Cultural nuances must be considered: Loyalty programs need to offer rewards appealing to local preferences, and the app should be translated and culturally adapted for each target country.  Economic factors, like varying levels of smartphone penetration and internet access, must be factored into implementation and marketing strategies.

The Problem In recent years, domains like NLP and computer vision have benefited enormously from the bitter lesson that general methods that are able to leverage computation are ultimately the most effective. The ability to scrape the internet for large, in-the-wild datasets has brought these fields from working well on academic benchmarks to becoming useful real-world products. However, although there is evidence that the same scaling laws likely apply to robotics as well, the field is stymied by lack of access to the same large, in-the-wild datasets that work well in other domains, resulting in foundation models with poor cross-embodiment and out-of-distribution generalization. While there has been a surge of investment in trying to grow these datasets, we view the capital-intensive, factory-first approach as unlikely to generate the scale and diversity of data required to make these robotics foundation models match the state-of-the-art seen in other fields. Our Solution We designed and built a fully-featured humanoid robot that anyone with a 3D printer and some time can build on their own. We are releasing it for anyone to build themself, along with an operating system that will enable the robot to perform basic task and learn from experience.  Our robot, Stompy, is a 4-foot humanoid robot featuring the claw gripper from the recent Universal Manipulation Interface paper, designed so that each part fits on a 256 \u00d7 256 3D printer bed, with a total bill of materials costing less than $10,000. We\u2019re using carbon fiber PAHT, but in principle, any reasonably strong plastic could be used instead. Our actuators are quasi-direct drives with between 6:1 and 8:1 reduction ratios, meaning that all the joints on our robot are low-inertia and back-drivable, with nominal torque values from 3-12 Nm. Each robot features a hot-swappable 48V 15Ah battery pack, which can power it for over an hour. We started designing Stompy from scratch shortly after the start of the YC batch. In the last three months, we built five different iterations of the hardware as we\u2019ve ironed out issues with assembly, part reliability, motor torque, and gripper design. Having worked with a number of robots in my professional career, including the Stretch from Hello Robot, the Spot from Boston Dynamics, and the early prototypes of the Optimus from Tesla, I feel confident saying that we have the best general-purpose hardware design for our BOM cost - and we are going to give it away for free.  Additionally, we have built the software tooling to train policies in simulation, using simulators like Isaac from Nvidia, and translate those policies to the robot. This enables anyone to get started developing models for simple tasks for free. We will also release the VLM we\u2019ve trained in-house as a foundation model for the robot perception stack, enabling developers to learn task-specific policies in a data-efficient manner.  About Us Our CEO (Ben) is a robotics researcher and engineer who has worked on robotics foundation models at Tesla and Meta AI. At Tesla, he wrote the CUDA kernel behind the voxel occupancy network, which served as the first perception foundation model to run in the Optimus. At Meta, his papers on speech and robotics representation learning have been cited over 2000 times. Our head of hardware (Matt) has degrees in mechanical engineering and computer science and has shipped real-world AI-powered and safety-critical hardware to production at Lockheed Martin and as the founder of his own startup, Malamute. Our head of software (Pawel) graduated with a PhD in dialogue systems from Cambridge and was most recently the head of ML at Poly AI, where he helped grow the company from five people to over 150. His machine-learning papers have been cited over 2000 times. Our Ask If you are interested in either building, buying, or developing a humanoid robot, please send an email to ben@kscale.dev with your request. We\u2019re working towards a future where anyone with a few 3D printers and some scrappiness can start a robot factory, and anyone who wants a humanoid robot will be able to get one. ",

We have shown our drugs work in mice and plan to begin human clinical trials next year, starting with the #1 cancer killer \u2013 lung cancer. OUR SCIENCE We\u2019ve discovered that cancers are addicted to a molecule called \u2018heme\u2019. Heme, which is well-known as the central component of \u2018hemoglobin\u2019, is used by the mitochondria to make energy. Cancers \u2018steal\u2019 free-floating heme from the blood to fuel their rapid growth. Our patented drugs starve cancer by removing this heme that cancer cells need, but normal cells don\u2019t. We\u2019ve shown in animals that our drugs are highly effective for multiple cancers, without affecting healthy cells, even at the highest doses. Also, by starving tumors, we make them weaker and more susceptible to existing cancer treatments, like radiation, chemo, and immunotherapies. The body has a natural system to clean up this free-floating heme, but it gets overwhelmed by cancer. Our drugs essentially amplify the body\u2019s natural heme removal system. We let nature do most of the work \u2013 our drugs are built from proteins that have evolved over millennia to be perfect at capturing heme. Importantly, heme is the exact same molecule across all mammals, meaning the results we see in animals have a higher chance of translating to humans. We\u2019re starting with lung cancer, with a lead drug advancing to first-in-human trials next year. Because multiple types of cancers have this same vulnerability, our lead drug could potentially be used for lots of cancer types and become a standard-of-care treatment. OUR TEAM Parsa and Pouya are twin brothers and scientists who spent their entire adult lives studying how cancers make energy. They worked together on this breakthrough science over the past 5 years, helping develop this promising new class of cancer drugs. They founded Velorum to advance this breakthrough to patients, surrounding themselves with a team of world-class drug developers, scientists, and clinicians.

We\u2019re Lucas and Raghav, the founding team behind Speck. \ud83e\udd14 The Problem People spend precious time doing menial and repetitive browser-based tasks, such as entering data into CRMs, posting multiple job listings for recruiting, reaching out to contacts on LinkedIn, extracting data from websites, and other similar chores. These tasks are irritating for most knowledge workers, yet they do not have any way to simplify their workflow. Low-code solutions like UiPath cost tens of thousands of dollars and require a dedicated automations team. On the other hand, executing web-based workflows is outside of the scope of workflow tools like Zapier. \ud83d\udca1 The Solution With Speck, you can automate any workflow easily without having any coding knowledge. Our browser extension allows you to record workflows just by doing them. Speck automatically translates your workflows into repeatable steps, making it simple for anyone to create web-based automations and data extraction processes By keeping track of intent, the browser automations will repair themselves automatically when something goes wrong! These workflows can be executed live or scheduled asynchronously on a remote browser. Now, our users can spend less time doing menial chores and more time focusing on higher-impact tasks. Since pivoting 2 weeks ago and launching our beta, we\u2019ve gotten our extension published on the Chrome Web Store and onboarded our first paying customers. Making an automation takes less than 60 seconds. Step 1 - Record your workflow  Step 2 - Extract Text  Step 3 - Run  And this is just the start!

This enables brokers to stand out and close more deals in an industry where service speed is critical, but mistakes are costly. Problem Insurance brokers spend 95% of their time reading through hundreds of pages of client files and entering information from one document to another. They must also keep logs of their activities and client information to comply with regulations.  Solving these problems requires a system that can extract data from all insurance documents. No solution has ever been able to achieve this, until now. Solution An AI-powered workspace for insurance workflows that enables brokers to generate any document they need in 3 clicks.  Today, Praxos does two things. First, it fills out insurance applications by extracting document data from brokers' clients. https://youtu.be/FD1r_ADmG0A   Second, Praxos condenses the detailed quotes returned by insurance companies into easy-to-read comparison tables that brokers and their clients can use to pick the best policy. For a typical business, these two tasks take more than 20 hours of painstaking work from trained experts. Meanwhile, every change to the data is logged in the background, ensuring that brokers always have a paper trail ready for their auditors. So what? Insurance professionals using Praxos report:  90% decrease in time spent generating documents. Zero time spent logging activity. Faster deal closure, with service times dropping from weeks to hours.

Still an engineer at heart and have a soft spot for Go.Daniel ChalefZep AI\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesGraphiti by Zep AI : A library for building dynamic Knowledge GraphsHey! We're Paul, Preston, and Daniel from Zep AI. We've just open-sourced Graphiti, a Python library for building temporal Knowledge Graphs using LLMs. https://youtu.be/sygRBjILDn8   Graphiti helps you create and query graphs that evolve over time. Think of a knowledge graph as a network of interconnected facts, such as \u201cKendra loves Adidas shoes.\u201d Each fact is a \u201ctriplet, represented by two entities, or nodes (\u201dKendra,\u201d \u201cAdidas shoes\u201d), and their relationship, or edge (\u201dloves\u201d). Knowledge Graphs have been explored extensively for information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build a knowledge graph while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context. At Zep, we build a memory layer for LLM applications. Developers use Zep to recall relevant user information from past conversations without including the entire chat history in a prompt. Accurate context is crucial for LLM applications. If an AI agent doesn't remember that you've changed jobs or confuses the chronology of events, its responses can be jarring or irrelevant, or worse, inaccurate. Zep\u2019s Suboptimal Fact Pipeline Before Graphiti, our approach to storing and retrieving user \u201cmemory\u201d was, in effect, a specialized RAG pipeline. An LLM extracted \u201cfacts\u201d from a user\u2019s chat history. Semantic search, reranking, and other techniques then surfaced facts relevant to the current conversation back to a developer for inclusion in their prompt. Unfortunately, this approach became problematic. Reconciling facts from increasingly complex conversations challenged even frontier LLMs such as gpt-4o. We saw incomplete facts, poor recall, and hallucinations. Our RAG search also failed at times to capture the nuanced relationships between facts, leading to irrelevant or contradictory information being retrieved. We tried fixing these issues with prompt optimization but saw diminishing returns on effort. We realized that a graph would help model a user\u2019s complex world, potentially addressing these challenges. Building Graphiti We were intrigued by Microsoft\u2019s GraphRAG, which expanded on RAG text chunking with a graph to better model a document corpus. However, it didn't solve our core problem: GraphRAG is designed for static documents and doesn't natively handle temporality.  So, we built Graphiti, a temporal Knowledge Graph library, which is designed from the ground up to handle constantly changing information, hybrid semantic and graph search, and scale:  Temporal Awareness: Tracks changes in facts and relationships over time. Graph edges include temporal metadata to record relationship lifecycles. Episodic Processing: Ingests data as discrete episodes, maintaining data provenance and enabling incremental processing. Hybrid Search: Semantic and BM25 full-text search, with the ability to rerank results by distance from a central node. Scalable: Designed for large datasets, parallelizing LLM calls for batch processing while preserving event chronology. Varied Sources: Ingests both unstructured text and structured data.  Getting Started Graphiti is open-source and available on GitHub: https://git.new/graphiti Quick Start: pip install graphiti-core While we developed Graphiti for our needs at Zep, we believe it could be useful for any application dealing with evolving, interconnected data, such as:  Personal AI assistants that need to maintain user context over time Knowledge management systems for rapidly changing domains Social network analysis tools Financial systems tracking changing relationships and transactions  If you try, we'd love to hear your thoughts, questions, and experiences.

See Who Our Customers Are:  User Experience See how our customers interact with Ryse:   Buyers:     Sellers:     Traction Since launching 10 weeks ago, we've signed a $100M term sheet with our first buyer, a $3B+ AUM asset manager. We are also engaged in late-stage negotiations on our first $50M seller term sheet, which is expected to close in Q2 2024. An Experienced Team Our founding team worked together at REZI (YC W17), a prop-tech company whose software aimed to make renting an apartment as simple as ordering on Doordash.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Adapting Ryse to the Hispanic Latin American market presents significant challenges.  The concept of a secondary market for real estate leases is relatively novel, requiring extensive education and trust-building among potential users.  Market size varies greatly across countries;  larger economies like Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia offer a potentially larger addressable market, but the level of sophistication in real estate investment may be lower compared to the US.  Cultural nuances regarding real estate transactions and financial investments need careful consideration.  The existing regulatory environment and infrastructure around real estate transactions in each country must be thoroughly analyzed and adapted to.  Economic factors, such as the prevalence of informal real estate markets and credit access, could impact adoption rates.  The reliance on advanced data integrations and standardization might face hurdles due to data quality and access limitations.  The higher concentration of smaller, less-formal real estate operations compared to large institutional players will necessitate a customized approach.  This requires a phased rollout, focusing on areas of higher investment maturity first. The initial target market would likely be institutional investors in major cities.",

This can include providing onboarding and customer support in Spanish/Portuguese.  4)  Implementing robust KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) procedures and adhering to local regulations. 5)  Data aggregation is key but will start with manual input to validate the market.

Previously, we built infrastructure at Palantir, Amazon, and Bloomberg \u2014 now, we\u2019re building an open-source platform to help developers understand how their LLM apps perform in production.  Why do LLM apps need observability from day 0?  LLMs are stochastic, and designing robust software around them (e.g., RAG, Agents) is an iterative process. A great observability platform not only facilitates this process, but actually makes it more productive. Hence, many AI developers adopt observability tools early on. Laminar goes beyond single LLM call tracing and provides tools for entire app instrumentation and powerful UI for full trace visualization, trace search, and session grouping. What is different about analytics for LLM apps?  LLM apps produce traces, which are essentially very rich text. Traditional event-based analytics tools are not built for extracting metrics from this kind of data. Currently, AI devs spend a good chunk of their time manually inspecting traces to understand usage patterns of their LLM apps. As they scale, manual inspection is not feasible anymore. Laminar tackles this problem by using other LLMs to process rich text outputs in the background. With Laminar, developers can define custom events, such as \u201cUSER SENTIMENT,\u201d to collect user sentiments and track this metric at scale as they deploy their LLM apps into production. Each event is linked to the trace that produced it, and developers can understand when and why certain semantic events have happened. It gives developers deeper understanding of the performance and usage of their LLM apps.

        "feasibility_analysis": "DGI Apparel's model presents a unique opportunity within the Latin American market, but requires careful adaptation.  The market size for custom apparel is substantial, particularly in countries with strong informal economies and a vibrant street-wear culture.  However, the reliance on existing vendor accounts poses a challenge. Many smaller custom apparel shops in Latin America may not use the online ordering systems that DGI integrates with, preferring direct contact or informal relationships with suppliers.  Cultural nuances also need consideration; trust and personal relationships are highly valued in business dealings in many Latin American countries, potentially impacting adoption.  Economic factors, such as inconsistent internet access and varying levels of digital literacy among target users, must also be addressed.  A phased rollout, focusing initially on larger, more digitally advanced businesses in major cities, could mitigate these risks.",

I\u2019m Aiden, founder of Million \u2014 we\u2019re building a tool that helps fix slow React code. Here is a quick demo:     Fixing web performance issues is hard. Every developer knows this experience: we insert console.log everywhere and catch some promising leads, but nothing happens before \"time runs out.\" Eventually, the slow/buggy code never gets fixed, problems pile up on a backlog, and our end users are hurt. We started Million to fix this. A VSCode extension that identifies slow code and suggests fixes (like Grammarly, for performance!) The website is here: https://million.dev/blog/lint I realized this was a problem when I tried to write an optimizing compiler for React in high school (src: https://github.com/aidenybai/million). It garnered a lot of interest (14K+ stars) and usage, but it didn't solve all user problems. Traditionally, devtools either hinge on full static analysis OR runtime profiling. We found success in a mixture of the two with dynamic analysis. During compilation, we inject instrumentation where it's necessary. From there, the runtime collects this info and feeds it back into VSCode. This is a great experience! Instead of switching around windows and trying to interpret flamegraphs, you can just see it inline with your code. We are still in the very early days of experimentation! Million Lints focuses on solving unnecessary re-renders right now and will move on to handling slow-downs arising from the React ecosystem: state managers, animations, bundle sizes, waterfalls, etc. Our eventual goal is to create a toolchain that keeps your whole web infrastructure fast, automatically - frontend to backend. In the next few weeks, we're planning to open source (MIT) the Million Lint compiler and the VSCode extension. To earn a living, we will charge a subscription model for customized linting. We believe this aligns our incentives with yours: we only make money when we make your app faster. We'd love to know your thoughts \u2013 happy to answer :) ",

(i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)Elias, originally from Sweden, was motivated by the challenge of running large language models on FPGAs to combat the high power consumption of modern GPUs. During a week-long event in London, Elias met Prithvi, whose expertise in electrical engineering, generative AI, and scientific research perfectly complemented his own.  They quickly recognized that advancing science and technology required a new computing paradigm - one that was both more powerful and sustainable. Driven by a shared passion for advancing humanity and accelerating technological progress, Elias, who had recently dropped out of university, and Prithvi, who had just graduated, founded Exa to revolutionize computing and push the boundaries of (artificial) intelligence. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?Exa's long-term vision is to eliminate hardware constraints in computing and artificial intelligence by creating hardware that is fully reconfigurable. This would remove the need to replace underlying hardware to support the latest AI models - a crucial consideration given the anticipated chip and silicon shortages in the coming decades. Given its reconfigurability, our hardware would therefore open up new possibilities in scientific machine learning (beyond just sentence generation), where flexible AI design is essential. This capability could lead to the discovery of new equations and scientific breakthroughs, fulfilling one of the original promises of artificial intelligence and machine learning in advancing human knowledge, and solving the worlds most pressing problems. We aim to enable individuals, organizations, and governments to run large-scale AI models on their own hardware, making AI fully decentralized and safe while significantly reducing energy costs. With modern GPUs, this would be impossible. As the AI revolution accelerates, models are becoming larger, and AI usage is surging exponentially. This trend is leading data centers to consume increasingly massive amounts of energy, potentially requiring the installation of dedicated power plants to meet demand in the future. For humanity to advance, we must discover a more sustainable way to run AI models. Exa is dedicated to providing this solution. Without it, we risk excessive energy consumption, which could potentially lead to the end of humanity as we know it. Exa computing is the most optimal way forward. ",

Credit: United24 The world is on fire, and we desperately need to fly the next generation of autonomous weapons, satellites, launch vehicles, hypersonics, and eVTOL aircraft. However, inefficient engineering software is slowing us down. We personally experienced the frustration of digging through hundreds of slides of primary structures analysis, setting up Excel hand-calcs with equations from Roark\u2019s, and missing flight deadlines. To accelerate the development of critical aerospace and defense hardware, we need to automate slow, tedious workflows for engineers. How we solve this Forerunner automates repetitive tasks in aerospace engineering. Today, Forerunner can:  Update turbopump design specs in Document A by querying and synthesizing test results from Documents B and C. Size the mass budget for a comms satellite using techniques in The New SMAD. Generate compliant test plans based on Air Force Space Command procedures. Analyze assembly instructions for an arming fuse and generate an inspection plan for QA. Track system-level requirements for a loitering munition; when new wingbox subsystem specs are uploaded, Forerunner flags and corrects any inconsistencies with system requirements.   ",

Schedule a meeting to discover more. Let's chat! \ud83d\ude42    \ud83d\udd12 Problem You\u2019re an engineer of an LLM app, trying to get the prompts just right. Every time you type something in, the output changes\u2014so you tweak a word here and there, and it changes again. Sometimes the outputs looks better, sometimes not. But you\u2019re never sure. Hours go by, all spent on prompt engineering. Getting the outputs you want can feel like an endless game of trial and error. And you\u2019re not alone. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve talked to over 100 YC companies, and a lot of them are facing the same challenges:  Measuring output quality is hard (You\u2019re heavily relying on manual evaluations at the moment.) Prompt engineering does not work as you want (You hate spending 5-7 hours a day searching for that one great prompt.)  \ud83d\udd11 Solution  We solve the problem with one simple formula: good input + right guidance = better prompts  Today, we launch Ape, your first AI Prompt Engineer. Inspired by\u00a0DSPy,\u00a0Reflexion,\u00a0Expel and other research papers, Ape iteratively improves your prompts. Here\u2019s how Ape works: 1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0Log your inputs and outputs to Weavel (with a single line of code!) 2\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0Let Ape filter the logs into datasets. 3\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0Ape then generates evaluation code and uses LLMs as judges for complex tasks. 4\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0\u001dAs more production data is added, Ape continues refining and improving prompt performance. How to use  Create a Dataset Change just one line of code to start logging LLM calls with the Weavel Python SDK. The SDK supports sync/async OpenAI chat completions and OpenAI structured outputs. You can also import existing data or manually create a dataset.  Create a Prompt Write a prompt that corresponds to your dataset. You can add an existing prompt as the base version, or if you prefer, create a blank prompt and provide a brief description for Ape to create a prompt from scratch.  Optimize Prompts To optimize your prompt using Ape, fill in the necessary information (e.g. JSON schema as you want) and then run the optimization process. An enhanced version of your prompt will be created and available soon. Ta-da! It\u2019s that easy. Ape outperforms with a remarkable 94.5% score on the GSM8K benchmark, surpassing Vanilla (54.5%), CoT (87.5%) and DSPy (90.0%).

We created Distro out of a passion for developing software for the \u201creal economy,\u201d and in particular for the trades. The Distro team is based in, and loves, NYC! \ud83d\uddfd \ud83d\ude05 The Problem Distributors, particularly those mid-size and smaller, face a long list of point-of-sale challenges these days. \ud83e\udde0 Brain drain: the most experienced reps are at or near retirement and are taking a great deal of tribal knowledge with them. \ud83d\udd27 Complex sales: quoting entire systems, load calculations, replacing legacy parts and equipment. \ud83d\udce6 Inventory challenges: growing SKU counts, supply chain disruptions, decreased inventorying by contractors. \ud83c\udf93 Training and retention: counter reps, in particular, are difficult to hire, train and retain. These issues are amplified by the increasing importance of counter and inside sales relative to the rest of the sales organization\u2013there has been a whopping 13 percentage point shift* towards counter staff and inside sales influencing purchasing decisions, moving away from territory managers/outside sales. To top it all off, there is the ever-present and growing threat of larger players that have the resources to throw money and bodies at the aforementioned problems. *\u00a02023-2024 State of the Channel, HARDI (Heating, Air-conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International) \ud83d\udd0d Our Approach What began as an academic curiosity about how to apply AI to distribution evolved into our team spending countless hours with distributor reps across the country over the course of a year, going deep on their day-to-day challenges, and building a distributor-centric solution from the ground up in partnership with several leading distributors. This experience\u2013fully immersing ourselves in a distribution vertical in order to go far beyond a superficial understanding of that vertical\u2019s product universe and sales workflows\u2013has shaped our product philosophy and overall approach. Some of our learnings: \ud83d\udccd Meet reps where they are: don\u2019t try to push reps to adapt to a totally new paradigm. Adapt our workflows to how things really work at the counter. \ud83d\ude80 Effortless onboarding: distributor IT teams don\u2019t need another tech project to distract them. Build solutions that avoid the need for long implementations. \ud83d\udd12 Data sanctity: distributors can spend a lot of time, energy, and money curating their data. Complete data security and privacy are necessary to protect that advantage. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Enhance, don\u2019t replace: the human element is the key to a distributor\u2019s value-add to its contractor customers. We\u2019re building Iron Man\u2019s suit, not the Terminator. \ud83d\udca1 Our Solution Our platform helps counter and inside sales reps work more efficiently by transforming complex customer requests into real-time product information and quotes. With Distro, reps can quote faster, boost conversion rates, and increase customer retention. We support distributors in sectors like HVAC/R, plumbing, electrical, and more.     \ud83d\ude4f Asks \ud83e\udd1d Connect with us: If you are a founder in the distribution, manufacturing, or contractor spaces, we\u2019d love to share learnings. \ud83d\udce3 Customer intros: distributors, contractors, and OEMs, particularly in HVAC/R, plumbing, and electrical.

Morgan AI Research Award, first-authored a Nature Neuroscience paper, cofounded Fractile, raised $15M in two years and exited.Yuhang SongCirclemind\u00a0Company LaunchesCirclemind - Better RAG using knowledge graphs and good old PageRankTL;DR \u2014 Circlemind is an open-source RAG that uses knowledge graphs and PageRank for more accurate retrieval. Our RAG is up to 3x more accurate than vector databases. Don\u2019t let poor RAG sabotage your AI application \u2014 check out our open-source repository or book a demo and experience the difference accurate retrieval makes. https://youtu.be/pGYYnYxRUHw   The Problem Building a good RAG pipeline these days takes a lot of manual optimizations. Most engineers intuitively start from naive RAG: throw everything in a vector database and hope that semantic search is powerful enough. This can work for use cases where accuracy isn\u2019t too important and hallucinations are tolerable, but it doesn\u2019t work for more difficult queries that involve multi-hop reasoning or more advanced domain understanding. Also, it\u2019s impossible to debug it. To address these limitations, many engineers find themselves adding extra layers like agent-based preprocessing, custom embeddings, reranking mechanisms, and hybrid search strategies. Much like the early days of machine learning when we manually crafted feature vectors to squeeze out marginal gains, building an effective RAG system often becomes an exercise in crafting engineering \u201chacks.\u201d  The Solution  Earlier this year, Microsoft seeded the idea of using Knowledge Graphs for RAG and published GraphRAG - i.e. RAG with Knowledge Graphs. We believe that there is a lot of potential in this idea, but existing implementations are naive in the way they create and explore the graph. That\u2019s why we developed Fast GraphRAG with a new algorithmic approach using good old PageRank. Knowledge graphs store entities and their relationships, and can help structure data in a way that enables more accurate and context-aware information retrieval. 12 years ago Google announced the knowledge graph we all know about. It was a pioneering move. Now we have LLMs, meaning that people can finally do RAG on their own data with tools that can be as powerful as Google\u2019s original idea.  As we understand that running agents and all the integrations necessary for Fast GraphRAG isn\u2019t trivial, we decided to offer a managed service that is dead simple to use. You can try it for free right now on our platform. We make it as simple as using any other database:  Another great benefit of using graphs is that they are understandable and debuggable:  So we added a built-in debugger tool which allows you to find and fix issues in your knowledge graph:  This is the kind of infrastructure that your AI application needs to handle large-scale real-world data. Our goal is to give you this infrastructure so that you can focus on what\u2019s important: building great apps for your users without having to care about manually engineering a retrieval pipeline. In the managed service, we also have a suite of UI tools for you to explore and debug your knowledge graph. We have a free hosted solution with up to 100 monthly requests.

We\u2019re Philip, Kyle, and Daniel from CommodityAI. We are building a platform for commodity traders to manage their shipments. tl;dr CommodityAI makes it easy for commodity trading companies to manage their shipments. One of the largest sugar traders uses our product to classify over a million documents, extract relevant fields from them, and organize them by shipment. They also use us to execute shipment-related workflows, like sending shipment status updates and generating vessel nominations. The Problem Shipping commodities requires a company to manage ~200 processes and over 50 documents. Now imagine you're managing thousands of shipments a month, and tens of thousands in a year. As a result, a trading company\u2019s workforce spends ~70% of their day on admin and 40% of operating costs are allocated to labor. Almost all of our customer calls have had one thing in common: the trader or operations person can recall a time in the past 6 months when a document or process error resulted in the firm losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. These processes also differ between customers. In other words, no 2 customers run their commodity trading operations the exact same way. This makes it difficult to build a one-size-fits-all solution without being intimately familiar with the space and the nuances of these shipments. The Solution We\u2019ve built AI, automation, and collaborative tools built specifically for commodities trading. Our customers use CommodityAI to manage thousands of shipments and process millions of shipment-related documents. This includes classifying them, extracting relevant fields, and organizing them. They also use our platform to automate a series of time-consuming, related tasks that they do in their day-to-day, such as tracking vessels, generating vessel nominations, and sending real-time updates to their counterparty. Document Processing Workflow: Classify, Extract data, create shipment  Track and Send Shipment Status Updates  Our goal is to ultimately take the number of manual processes within a commodities shipment down to 0, transforming the way commodity trading companies manage their operations. Ask We know there aren\u2019t too many commodity trading companies probably checking YC every day, but we do know many founders worked as traders or know traders from previous work experience!

We worked together at Palantir in the manufacturing vertical, where John focused on industrial chemicals while Shaashwat worked on commercial defense. Our work on the ground exposed some incredible risks to American advanced manufacturing, particularly around how data is managed (or mismanaged) in an operational context.  Problem  Data is stored in many formats, including various ERPs, PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files, across multiple different systems on the factory floor. This setup makes it difficult to answer basic questions, and answers are more often found in the heads of subject matter experts rather than in an easily accessible, uniform platform.  Solution Our solution enables manufacturers to:  Auto-integrate their disparate data into a singular knowledge base Query this knowledge base in natural language to provide visibility across their core processes. Implement workflows on top of this knowledge base to increase automation and improve overall decision-making.  By capturing and leveraging operational knowledge more effectively, this will ensure American manufacturing can continue to expand capacity in the coming decades. Why Now?  A wave of retirements, coupled with insufficient incoming skilled labor, will open up an estimated\u00a02.1 million unfilled advanced manufacturing roles by 2030. This knowledge loss necessitates increased efforts to automate processes and manage data more effectively to ensure these factories continue running at full capacity.  Curious for More?

Download it here (if you have Gmail and an iPhone!). The Problem Our inboxes are too noisy to manage and too important to ignore. 70% of people who have a full-time executive assistant start by having them manage their email and calendar. Why? It\u2019s an easy way to save time (say, an hour a day) and both platforms have enough context that an assistant can ramp up fairly quickly. We\u2019ve proven LLMs can do this for you, for a fraction of the cost of a human. We previously built Superfilter to tackle a similar problem, but we made a ton of mistakes. Thankfully those mistakes led us to a product people find very valuable. Enter Ceejay Using Ceejay is similar to the experience of chatting with a human assistant. Watch this 60-second video to understand what Ceejay can do for you.   Ceejay has a growing list of things it can do for you including: Searching your inbox: Why search your inbox for that receipt from July when you can ask Ceejay? Managing your schedule: Why send a calendar link or book an event when you can ask Ceejay (who handles conflicts!)? Highlight messages that matter: Why separate your important messages from the unimportant when Ceejay can do it for you? Learning about you: Ceejay is also the only inbox that deliberately remembers facts about you to reference later. I told Ceejay that my coworkers are Scott and Travis. Just ask, and you shall receive.\u00a0There\u2019s no additional inbox to manage. No new interface to learn.

We\u2019re Jude & Daniel, and we\u2019re the co-creators of Carousel, a change-tracking tool for PowerPoint & Excel.  Investment bankers & consultants don\u2019t use PowerPoint like you do: For most investment banking or consulting projects, the final deliverable is a PowerPoint deck.  To make sure the final draft of that deck is perfect, it goes through multiple rounds of review, feedback, & edits.  This means that many bankers and consultants spend hours squinting at different decks to see if the footnote on pg. 57 was updated correctly or if all the companies in a table on pg. 34 have uniform EBITDA adjustments.  Small details matter a lot, so teams often have to check over hundred-page decks from scratch. This review process is tedious & prone to mistakes.  Track deck & model changes with one click:  Carousel is a PowerPoint & Excel add-in that captures all the changes made to your team\u2019s materials from shell to client PDF.  Carousel tells you exactly WHO changed WHAT and WHEN. With one click, the add-in highlights everything that changed between any two versions of the model or deck (in your current window, without having to open another file).

My roots in Detroit\u2014the Motor City\u2014fuel my passion for melding technology with manufacturing. Growing up with summers in factories and a family deeply embedded in the auto industry, from my dad's factory insights to my mom's work on control systems  for Chrysler, I was fascinated by how cars come to life.Akash KumarDime\u00a0Company Launches\u2699\ufe0fDime: AI Data Engineer for Hardware ManufacturersHi \ud83d\udc4b We\u2019re Akash and Ashish, and we\u2019re really excited to be launching Dime! Check out our launch video!   TL;DR: Dime enables manufacturers to utilize their telemetry data to anticipate and prevent equipment and hardware product failures. Our AI agent identifies patterns of key failure modes and builds ML models to prevent them. What do we help? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Hardware manufacturers collect enormous amounts of data from their products and manufacturing lines\u2014everything from customer feedback and operator logs to IoT sensor data, ERP records, and more. Manufacturing and Process Engineers tap into this data to root cause manufacturing and end-product failures. So What\u2019s the Problem? \u26a0\ufe0f Data Infra setup for Manufacturing and Process Engineers is a complex, time-consuming process. Here\u2019s why:  Cumbersome Data Collection: Engineers need to gather massive volumes of real-time data from various sources and set up streaming pipelines Time-Consuming Data Preparation: Parsing, transforming, and cleaning this data takes significant effort before any analysis can begin and must be done every time engineers run analyses. Complex Analysis Process: Running relevant statistical and machine learning models requires specialized expertise, making it difficult to extract actionable insights quickly Difficult To Repeat: Even after insights are gained, setting up a reliable production ML workflow is challenging, especially for those without data science or software engineering backgrounds  The Solution? \ud83d\ude80 Dime's Data Studio aggregates data across industrial systems and abstracts the infrastructure needed to reliably extract, transform, and use that data. Here are some potential use cases: Repair & Service Applications Hardware products generate tons of telemetry data in the field, which often gets stored in large warehouses. Retrieving and analyzing this data manually can be time-consuming, but with Dime, customers can set up automated workflows to spot issues as data streams in\u2014no need for complex ETL pipelines. Dime\u2019s custom models detect potential component failures and alert customers when repairs are due, helping products stay in customers' hands longer.  In this example, the user has numerous products streaming telemetry data to a Snowflake data warehouse. When these products come in for repairs, engineers often download the telemetry data and analyze it using tools like JMP or Excel, spotting patterns that help pinpoint specific component failures. Having identified these patterns, they wanted a way to automate the process to avoid manual analysis each time. With Dime, they can set up automated workflows effortlessly. Dime builds models based on patterns seen over hundreds of repairs and runs daily workflows to detect specific component anomalies, notifying the user instantly. This automation saves hours of diagnostic time and ensures faster, targeted repairs, reducing costs and downtime. Customer Feedback Escalation Hardware products often generate substantial customer feedback, like the classic \"send to Apple\u201d on your iPhone. This feedback typically lands in data warehouses, where product engineers must download it into Excel sheets and sift through it to identify areas for improvement. With Dime, workflows can be set up to automatically analyze all incoming customer feedback using LLMs, categorize it, and trigger the necessary escalation steps\u2014ensuring faster action on critical issues.

Was previously doing my PhD in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto where I built the first at-home brain tumour monitoring system with a BCI device.  I have spent the last five years implementing and training deep learning networks for biomedical applications including papers published that use ML/DL for diagnostics.Rick SugdenAutoComputer\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesAutoComputer - Zero setup AI automation for your computerAutoComputer helps you automate and accelerate workflows on your computer without any explicit configuration, while keeping you in-charge. With just a prompt and your recent activity, our desktop AI system starts predicting the next sequence of actions \u2013 keystrokes, text input, mouse clicks \u2013 that you can keep accepting with a single keystroke. This saves you time and effort while providing you complete visibility and control over the completed tasks. We\u2019re starting with helping businesses and enterprises automate repetitive, but business-critical workflows such as financial data entry, record keeping, and transaction matching. Watch our demo video below to see AutoComputer in action! https://youtu.be/tcFpwrvB7FE    \\ The Context As engineers, we have tools like Github Copilot, Cursor and software engineering agents that help us accelerate and automate large swaths of our programming workflows with AI. However, outside programming, this is not the case. Many professionals in roles such as accounting, consulting and bizops have repetitive, critical workflows that they want to accelerate or automate with software, but they don\u2019t yet have an ideal solution for this.  \\ The Problem Based on talking to these users, we learnt that the current generation of RPA and AI Agent-driven automation solutions for their workflows have 3 core issues: Trust and Accountability For many tasks they need to ensure accuracy and take accountability. So RPA and Agents that just go off do the task for them are not a viable option. They need full visibility and control while the automation executes. Configuration Complexity Real-world workflows are complex and span multiple apps and files. Many solutions can\u2019t handle them without the heavy setup, onboarding, or migration required with the current generation of RPA tools or AI agent-driven automation solutions. Automation Flexibility Workflows change frequently across formats and tools and they want automations that can adapt on the fly without reconfiguration. Most automations fail on the slightest variation in data formats, schemas or sources introduced when they had new clients, cases and customers.  \\ The Solution With just a prompt, our desktop AI system automates steps for any complex computer usage workflow that they can accept with a single keystroke. It makes repetitive but critical workflows such as financial data entry 2-5x faster, while providing complete visibility, control, and adaptability\u2014all without requiring any setup, recording, or onboarding to a new platform. Here\u2019s a how it works:  The user opens the AutoComputer app on Windows/MacOS and provides a prompt for their task. AutoComputer understands the context of the task and comes up with a sequence of automated steps of mouse and keyboard input to complete the task.

We met at university ~7 years ago while doing research in Physics. We have been friends and roommates and have hacked on multiple research and side projects together. Rick recently dropped out of his PhD where he worked on training transformers on brain-wave data for diagnosis, and built the first at-home brain-tumour monitoring system which he patented. Madhav worked at Replit as one of the first engineers on the AI team where he led research and training for all of Replit\u2019s models, and worked on data infrastructure, Replit\u2019s core AI services and, most recently, Replit Agent. Based on our experience in AI research and building products like the Replit Agent, we believe that SOTA models are just crossing the threshold of capability where they can start usefully automating and accelerating large parts of knowledge work beyond just software engineering.

However, the deployment and operation of these models, particularly those exceeding a few billion parameters, present significant challenges regarding hardware capabilities, energy consumption, and operational costs. Traditional approaches to this problem typically fall into two categories:  Utilize massive, power-hungry GPU clusters to distribute the computational load. Compromise on model size and capabilities to fit within existing hardware constraints on the edge.  Both of these approaches have significant drawbacks. GPU clusters are expensive to acquire and operate, with substantial energy costs and complex cooling requirements. They also introduce latency issues due to inter-device communication and can\u2019t be deployed on the edge. On the other hand, compromising on model size can limit the AI's capabilities and potential applications, putting organizations at a competitive disadvantage.  \ud83d\udcc8 The Solution We help eliminate the need for inefficient distributed computing and compromised model capabilities by providing a full-stack system where we run transformer-based models on a single chip, including existing hardware. Our solution can run on a custom ASIC, dramatically reducing power consumption and operational costs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctVUhuXgeA    Here's why this is a game-changer:  Immediate Deployment:\u00a0Your large-scale AI model can be operational on a single chip, eliminating the need for complex distributed setups. This means you can leverage the full power of multi-billion parameter models right from the start. Customization:\u00a0The chiplet architecture allows for near-infinite customization, enabling hardware/software co-design tailored to specific client needs. Efficiency:\u00a0Even on existing Nvidia hardware, our software provides a 5x reduction in memory usage Ease of Use:\u00a0Developers can switch their linear layer with our optimized version, dramatically simplifying the integration process and democratizing access to large-scale AI capabilities.

Problem Post-pandemic, dental practices have struggled to maintain profitability and growth due to staff shortages and rising overhead costs. In the face of these issues, they also continue to miss out on thousands of dollars in high-margin revenue due missed appointments and poor scheduling practices, as many rely on manual and inefficient workflows for patient scheduling. What makes it even trickier is that patient behavior is unpredictable, with patients regularly canceling their appointments and going inactive, creating additional strain on the front desk. Solution Hemingway is an AI patient scheduler for dental practices. Through one-click, practices integrate our software with their existing EHR. Our AI agent books unscheduled patients, handles inbound requests for appointments, and automatically reschedules cancellations as they occur. We enable booking through phone, text, and web-based chat. Our software books a patient a day on average for customers, leading to thousands in net new revenue per week.

We used to lead a reusable rocket program and oversaw the launch of four missions. We hated engineering design software so much that we created our own \u2014\u00a0which is why we\u2019re here today :)  \ud83e\udde8 The Problem: Design errors get caught too late, resulting in delays or dangerous outcomes. Organizations carry out design reviews every few weeks/months to ensure they catch errors early. As aerospace engineers, we've experienced firsthand the painful reality of cross-team design reviews. Teams grind for weeks to prepare for these meetings, yet costly errors still slip through to manufacturing or even operation (think doors blowing off planes). The issue? Engineers work in silos, unaware of how their decisions impact the broader system. For example, changing the O-ring material might unexpectedly impact the seal integrity at low temperatures when building a space shuttle booster rocket (see NASA Space Shuttle Disaster below \u2b07\ufe0f).  \ud83c\udf89 The Solution: Autonomously detecting errors across an organization. Humans are terrible at dealing with large amounts of data and understanding how everything interacts with one another. Machines, on the other hand, are great! They can crawl across all the knowledge bases (GitHub, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.) and detect changes as they are made. Our platform identifies design problems autonomously across engineering projects. It then suggests targeted solutions to the right engineers and delivers daily insights and reviews, preventing expensive problems early on (poor engineering cost Boeing $100B+). This saves each engineer two months of work every year and makes engineering safer.  \ud83d\udcb2Opportunity: Safer and quicker engineering Engineers don\u2019t need to spend two months a year grinding for design reviews. Your engineering projects don\u2019t need to be delayed by an average of seven months.

Our platform enables US and Canadian merchants to seamlessly integrate Apple Care-like warranty programs for any eligible product, from ovens to bikes. We achieve this with nearly zero onboarding and operating costs, allowing merchants to offer these warranties in just minutes across any sales channel.  What is the problem? \u274c The cost of offering product warranties is exponentially high for merchants and insurers. As it follows,  Resource-Intensive Integration: Merchants must create a file transfer-based system to integrate with insurers. Additionally, they need to develop internal tools to apply the correct warranty plans to products, build custom UIs, and manage data collection, sharing, and tracking to meet both insurer and regulatory requirements. This entire process can take six months to a year to go live. Recurring Additional Work: Maintaining integrations and tools requires dedicated engineering teams. Running the warranty program also requires dedicated time from the operation team. This usually requires additional hiring.  Below is what the current merchant landscape looks like,  How is SureBright Solving these problems? \ud83c\udf89 SureBright\u2019s warranty program runs on auto-pilot, empowering merchants of all sizes and providing the following key benefits:  99% less onboarding time, no onboarding or operating costs, and no recurring tasks or hiring required.

We have over 9 years working in data teams for companies like Microsoft, Kaiser Permanente, Crexi, and Abbott.  As data people, 80%-90% of our time was dedicated to low-level data requests. When really, the true business value of data comes from answering the \u201cwhy\u201d questions.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Kater.ai presents a compelling proposition, but its feasibility in the Latin American market requires careful consideration.  The market size for advanced data analytics tools is growing, particularly in larger companies across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. However, widespread adoption faces challenges. Many smaller and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Latin America lack the robust data infrastructure (mature data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery) that Kater.ai currently supports.  Cultural nuances also play a role; convincing companies to adopt a fully automated AI-driven analytics solution might require a phased approach, focusing on initial trust-building and demonstrating clear ROI.  Economic factors are crucial; pricing needs to be competitive and adaptable to various market segments.

        "feasibility_analysis": "DryMerge's core value proposition \u2013 automating tasks with plain English \u2013 holds significant potential in the Latin American market.  The market size is substantial, encompassing numerous knowledge workers across various industries. However, several considerations are crucial.  Firstly, language adaptation is paramount. While English proficiency is growing, Spanish-language support is essential for widespread adoption.  Secondly, the target audience should be carefully segmented. While the US market leans toward programmers adopting no-code tools,  Latin American adoption may initially focus on smaller businesses and individual professionals seeking efficiency improvements. This requires targeted marketing emphasizing ease of use and time-saving benefits, rather than focusing on the technical aspects.  Thirdly, economic factors should be addressed. Pricing strategies must consider varied income levels. A freemium model or tiered pricing could increase accessibility.  Finally, robust customer support in Spanish is crucial for overcoming potential language barriers and building trust.",

Our first customer, a real estate marketplace, uses Plume to provide potential buyers with precise energy renovation scenarios, cutting the time to sell a house in half.  Using thermodynamic models, public housing data, satellite imagery and AI,  Plume enables remote energy assessments of any building.  In Europe alone, 35 million homes face regulatory pressure to be retrofitted within the next 5 years, and 220 million over the next 25 years.

But where should you start? Plume helps you at every step of the improvement journey, making the process seamless. Try it out for your home! Meet the founding team behind PLUME - JB, Marc & Edouard!  \u274c The problem: Electricity prices are on the rise, and regulations, especially in Europe, are getting tougher on home energy efficiency requirements. For example, in France, 20% of homes are not able to be rented because of their low energy efficiency rating. That\u2019s 7 million homes in need of solutions. Homeowners like Roman, one of our first clients, needed to take action. He has a house in the Pyrenees, where his energy bill has increased by 60% in a year.  The first step he did was assess the current energy efficiency of his home. It cost him hundreds of dollars for an expert to visit his house. The second step was to understand what options were available for his specific house. Was it installing an HVAC, insulating his walls, or even controlling his EV charging? The third step was to choose the best option. He had to understand prices, government subsidies, the impact on his energy bill, and the overall return on investment. Roman had to call a dozen contractors. The final step was to find trusted contractors to do the work.  Roman never completed his home energy efficiency project. It took him months, required extensive research, involved dozens of different people, and introduced a lot of opportunities for error. That\u2019s what Plume is here to change for Roman and all homeowners. \u2705 The solution: On your personal account, you start by answering a few simple questions to assess your home. Then, our AI software uses thermodynamic models, public housing data, energy consumption data, and satellite imagery to compute your current energy efficiency. Next, we find the most cost-effective solutions for your specific house to increase your energy efficiency. You get an instant price, factoring in government subsidies, ROI, and installment time. All in one click. Finally, select what fits your needs, and we will connect you with our network of selected and trained contractors and ensure the work is done. Plume helps you at every step of that journey, making the process seamless, trustworthy, and 10 times faster.  \ud83d\udcc8 The market: With energy prices going up, homeowners are now pressured by their energy bills and regulations to care about building efficiency. The good news is that homes are electrifying enabling new tools to improve their home energy efficiency. Looking only at France: 20% of houses are not able to be rented because of their low energy efficiency rating. That\u2019s 7 million homes requiring an average home energy renovation of $20k. This represents $140B in renovation that will be done in the next three years. \ud83d\ude4f Our Ask: Test it out in your house!

Check out my video message to you:   The problem Video is expensive to produce. It is used for branding rather than performance and is usually the last resort employed after everything is exhausted (ads, SEO, etc.). Yet, it is the highest performing media out there. It can engage leads and clients (branding, masterclasses), sell (UGC), and make internal documents more engaging (FAQ, trainings). The solution By building a SOTA deepfake model and a platform to generate videos, we\u2019re making it insanely easy to create and grow your audience with video, regardless of your goals:  Clone yourself with 2 minutes of video, or use one of our avatars Input a text or voice script Generate a fully edited, engaging video complete with subtitles & media in a few clicks  All of it is also available via our API \ud83d\udc40  What\u2019s magic?

Even if you\u2019re shy, you should leverage video on social media to share stories, knowledge, and engage. If you record ONE good 2-minute video of yourself, you\u2019re set for life.  We just released a feature that will help you generate your first LinkedIn video and get ahead of the release of their \u201cshorts\u201d feature - try it out! Education One of the most effective marketing strategies is to educate your prospects on how to solve their pain - you can use lead magnets (free training videos in exchange for their email or action on their part), or generate video documentation on your platform to convert/upsell.  Promotion (screencasts, UGC) Having influencers sell your product is a huge pain: you need to find them, brainstorm ideas with them, pay them, give them an affiliate plan, etc. How cool would it be to generate 100 ads for your product effortlessly? That\u2019s what we allow doing with our UGC avatars.  Entertainment YouTuber Kwebblekop (15m subscribers) has created an automated pre-production pipe that then calls our API. He generates 1000 shorts/month with the platform, and his channel is growing with an entirely automated workflow. The founders  We met 10 years ago while working at French scale-up Teads.

Our NFC-enabled badges turn every field service interaction into a frictionless moment\u2014easily capturing reviews, payments, and insights.

Previously, Dylan interned at Microsoft Azure and other Utah-based B2B Tech companies as a product manager & software engineer. Dylan graduated Cum Laude from BYU with a degree in computer science, and originally hails from Dallas, Texas.Dylan AllenCheers\u00a0Company LaunchesCheers: The super-app for in-person employeesTL;DR: We\u2019re Cheers, building the super-app for in-person employees (think home services, restaurants, D2D sales). We\u2019re starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that make key tasks\u2014like collecting reviews and verifying employment\u2014seamless. It\u2019s our first step toward becoming the central platform for in-person work. \ud83e\udd42 What is Cheers? Cheers is on a mission to revolutionize how in-person employees work. We\u2019re building the super-app that will become the central hub for everything these employees need\u2014from managing schedules and tracking performance to accepting tips and capturing customer feedback\u2014all through NFC technology pre-enabled on smartphones today.  \ud83e\udde8 The Problem We Solve: In-person customer and employee interactions are often inefficient and filled with friction. Whether it\u2019s collecting feedback, verifying employment, or capturing leads, these processes are typically slow, manual, and prone to errors. This inefficiency not only frustrates employees and customers but also leads to missed opportunities for businesses to optimize and grow. Check out how it looks here: https://youtu.be/yfW_QonAPEE   Cheers aims to make every in-person interaction seamless, frictionless, and measurable. We\u2019re starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that go beyond basic identification. These badges enable employees to perform key actions with just a tap\u2014whether it\u2019s gathering a 5-star Google Review, collecting a lead, or verifying employment\u2014right when it matters most, face-to-face with the customer.  \ud83d\ude80 Why We\u2019re Excited About Cheers: We believe that these badges are our wedge into businesses. They address immediate needs (better Google Reviews, etc.) while laying the groundwork for something much bigger. As employees and owners tap into Cheers\u2019 early features, they quickly see the value in capturing and attributing customer interactions to individual employees. That means the right employees get the proper credit and feedback, which is actionable at a more granular level. We\u2019ve already seen this open the door to deeper integration across operations. (also, Apple made an announcement about iOS 18.1 that really excites us, check it out here.) Example: Imagine an employee tapping their badge to allow a customer to leave a 5-star Google Review in just 3 taps: notification, rating, post. Or, picture a customizable employee page where customers can perform multiple actions\u2014like booking services or leaving feedback\u2014all in one place.  \ud83d\udcc8 Our Traction: We have 25 customers, the majority of which are small businesses, like your local bridal shop or burger joint. We have one enterprise-level client with whom we\u2019ve been running a successful paid pilot for the past 2 months. We\u2019ve grown our MRR from ~$1,400 on July 1st to ~$4,000 now. Cheers has already processed over 3,000 internal and external reviews for our customers. Our reporting software is delivering real results\u2014our average customer has 5-10x\u2019ed their monthly 5-star Google Reviews. Managers are using it to track performance, run competitions, and provide targeted feedback. (See the screenshot below for a look at what our customers do when hosting competitions).  But this is just the start. We\u2019re building Cheers to be the central operating system for in-person businesses\u2014a platform that will transform how in-person teams operate, from scheduling and payments to customer engagement and beyond. \ud83d\ude4f Our Ask to You: We\u2019re looking for intros to folks who manage\u2014or know someone who manages\u2014in-person, customer-facing teams: anything from self-storage to solar sales. Cheers is especially helpful for companies that currently struggle with getting online reviews (Google, TripAdvisor, Thumbtack, etc.). Our first product, the Cheers NFC-enabled employee badge, is already delivering strong results, and with your help, we can build something truly impactful. Request a text from one of us, or schedule a call with our CEO Dylan, here. And finally, a toast, to people like you. Cheers! \ud83e\udd42 ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Cheers' NFC-enabled badge system presents a mixed bag for the Hispanic Latin American market.  The core concept of streamlining customer interactions and feedback collection is highly relevant across various industries. However, several factors need careful consideration. Market size varies significantly across countries; adoption in larger, more technologically advanced economies like Mexico, Colombia, and Chile would likely be higher than in smaller, less developed nations. Cultural nuances around review systems and digital adoption must be assessed; some cultures may be less inclined to leave online reviews compared to others. Economic factors also play a significant role; the pricing model needs to be competitive for the target market segment of small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), many of whom operate on tight budgets.

Payments around the world are very fragmented and rely heavily on cash, or an alternative like QR code digital wallets.

I've worked with Fortune 100 companies at Palantir to build their data engineering, modeling, and analytics capabilities. I've also helped several startups spin up data infrastructure and machine learning models from zero to one as a founding data engineer.  I'm pouring everything I've learned into Coblocks.Kevin SchaichCoblocks\u00a0\u00a0Nisola Shobayo, CTO & Co-FounderCTO @ Coblocks  Nisola previously built investing, payment and developer platforms at Cash App and Square. He helped rebuild Square's card storage infrastructure from the ground up and led engineering teams that built some of the fastest growing 0 to1 products ever at Cash App -- P2P Stocks & Teen Investing.  Nisola is now taking his experience scaling platforms to build the easiest way to work data @ Coblocks.Nisola ShobayoCoblocks\u00a0Company LaunchesCoblocks - Build data pipelines in minutes with AI\u23e9\u00a0TL;DR Coblocks is a thoughtfully-designed data platform that helps teams write queries and automate workflows faster. We understand the columns, tables, and relationships in your data and use them to help anyone on your team build pipelines with AI, SQL and Python. Think of us like Cursor for data engineering. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfKpDh-Zbw   \ud83d\ude29\u00a0The Problem We've spoken with dozens of startups facing issues scaling their data infrastructure \u2013 existing tools are slow to spin up, complex, and expensive. Enterprise data platforms don\u2019t care about the needs of scaling companies (wasted \ud83d\udcb0).  You pay for a massive platform, even if you only use a fraction of the tools. Long sales cycles & high contract values are untenable for startups. Steep learning curves require training your employees or hiring a data team.  Rolling your own data platform with scripts or open-source is hard (wasted \u23f3).  Developers spend weeks or months spinning up and configuring infrastructure. Frequent errors lead to poor data quality and ongoing maintenance burdens. Teams start with one tool & find out they also need to handle orchestration, permissions, metadata, health checks, monitoring, observability, etc. Tooling is frustrating, UX is bad, it\u2019s not super fun to work with or debug things.  When growing your business, you need something you can count on that doesn\u2019t compromise on any of these dimensions. \ud83d\udc4c\u00a0The Solution We think your team\u00a0deserves\u00a0data tools they actually enjoy using. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re different:  All-in-one: You can get started in 2 minutes \u2013\u00a0no setup or configuration required. We have one-click integrations, warehousing, transformation, and schedules all built in.

During my master\u2019s program, I founded a startup called Traffic Intelligence, focusing on innovative traffic management solutions. My professional journey has taken me across Europe, starting with at Microsoft in Dublin, followed by Amazon in Barcelona, Spain. I later founded a software consultancy Blue Chestnut before joining Diffusion Studio as a co-founder.Matthias RuizDiffusion Studio\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesDiffusion Studio - The AI Video EditorTL;DR Diffusion Studio is an AI-powered video editing application that automates repetitive editing tasks right in the browser. Diffusion Studio takes advantage of recently released Webcodecs and WebGPU to encode, process, and decode videos with hardware acceleration. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbMyfluvdYU   The Founders Konstantin\u2019s last job was developing signal-processing devices for a large German manufacturer. As soon as WebGPU was released, Konstantin started to work on building applications using that technology. This led him to start Diffusion Studio. Matthias previously built a startup that used AI-driven video processing to detect and track traffic participants on hardware-constrained devices. Through that, Matthias gathered valuable experience in hyper-optimizing video processing AI to run on everyday devices in real time.  The Problem Creating fully polished and publishable video content is a time-intensive task, with each minute of a finished video requiring about an hour of tedious editing. This often means making several precise, manual adjustments. Some content creators try to solve this by outsourcing editing to low-wage countries but face issues with language barriers, endless back and forth, and reduced quality of the finished videos. There\u2019s a need for a simple video editing tool with a set of robust, focused features that enable the production of high-quality videos. The Solution Diffusion Studio fills that need by automating large parts of the editing process. The auto edit feature automatically eliminates filler words, pauses, repetitive starts, and redundant explanations. Further editing the auto-edit draft is also easy with Diffusion Studio\u2019s simple UI, which allows users to edit the video directly using either the transcript or the timeline. Additionally, Diffusion Studio runs entirely in the user's browser on the user\u2019s hardware, which means there are no uploads or downloads to wait on once the video has been edited.

We want to take in tons of CO2 to help reverse climate change while also working to decarbonize supply chains, so carbon capture becomes redundant in the first place.  \u2014 Hey everyone! We\u2019re Connor, Vignesh, and Ankit \u2013 the cofounders of Anthrogen (formerly Arctic Capture). This is actually our second Launch YC post of the batch (first one here under the name Arctic Capture) \u2013 we decided we needed a relaunch/rebrand. In our first launch we promised carbon capture with genetically engineered bacteria. In this one, we are happy to tell you that we have exceeded what we originally thought was possible at the beginning of the summer; we\u2019re not just focused on bacterial carbon capture but also on recombinant protein expression and generative protein models \u2013 all coming together under a single unified platform. Polymers are everywhere, we are not very good at creating them sustainably. Current carbon dioxide removal technologies are expensive and/or inefficient. From plastics to fuels to foods to fabrics to carbon stores \u2013 every facet of our lives is defined by polymers. Publicly traded companies live and die by the prices of these carbon chains and with the price of crude oil, inefficient catalytic processes, looming threats of legislation/public pressure around carbon emissions, these companies worth trillions of dollars are in a precarious position. We need a way to produce polymers cheaper, sustainably. Solugen became a $2b startup in 5 years by using sugar instead of oil as a base of these reactions \u2013 is there another source of carbon we can use instead? Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies are also prohibitively expensive \u2013 current high-quality solutions still cost >$1000 per ton of CO2 capture. With more than two-thirds of the Fortune 500 pledging net-zero goals in the next decade, a cost-efficient solution to decarbonization is worth billions. Our solution? We are creating a platform that allows for both CDR and low-cost polymer manufacturing while sidestepping traditional roadblocks of scaling up bacterial cultures using generative models and CRISPR. We\u2019ve figured out a way to make the most productive cyanobacterial species (cyanobacteria were the organisms behind the Great Oxidation Event ~2bn years ago) grow even faster \u2013 to the best of our knowledge, going through the literature on the topic, we have created the fastest photosynthesizing organism alive. We have also determined chemoenzymatic processes from the cyanobacteria\u2019s enzyme output that can create starch from carbon dioxide. We are starting with starch as the quintessential polymer but hope to have a process that is generalizable enough to reapply to other more valuable polymers down the line.  Fig 1: Some of our bacteria! These are all engineered strains to various degrees \u2013 with one of the more promising ones on the left (the deeper the green, the better the growth).

        "feasibility_analysis": "Anthrogen's technology, while innovative, faces significant hurdles in the Latin American market.  The high technical complexity and capital requirements make immediate widespread implementation unlikely. Market size for this specific application (jet/rocket fuel) is extremely limited in the region.  Cultural nuances related to environmental concerns are present but less developed than in other regions. Economic factors, such as the prevalence of informal economies and limited governmental support for high-tech ventures, pose challenges.  However, a pivot toward more readily accessible applications (e.g., bioplastics for packaging or agricultural applications) could improve market adaptability.  The success hinges on securing substantial funding and navigating regulatory complexities related to genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which vary significantly across Latin American countries.

Our goal is to empower the best financial advisors (the independents!) to serve all Americans who want financial advice.  We are starting with growth, which is the most existential problem advisors face.   The organic growth process is highly inefficient and full of noise. Advisors often waste 60 hours of business development to convert 1 new client.    At FINNY, we are certain we can do better with AI. With our tool, advisors can: - Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead - Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair - Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects  In essence, doing all the work for the advisors, and letting them focus on what actually matters, the client relationship.Latest NewsYC-backed Finny is using AI to match financial advisors with prospects | TechCrunchDec 11, 2024Finny and the Great AdvisorTech Acceleration | Wealth ManagementAug 12, 2024FINNY AIFounded:2024Team Size:4Location:New YorkGroup Partner:Michael Seibel\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersEden Ovadia, FounderEden is the Co-founder and CEO of FINNY.

Our first product, a multi-channel Sales agent, allows users to sit back and relax while it goes \u201cout in the wild\u201d (aka our massive database of high-net-worth individuals) and prospects for them. It\u2019s like your intern, except it\u2019s always on, running in the background. FINNY\u2019s goal is for advisors to wake up in the morning to meetings with prospects on their calendars, entirely booked by FINNY. Our value proposition is three-fold:   Prospect identification:  We identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead and constantly monitoring for life triggers     Prospect prioritization:  We prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair    Prospect outreach & engagement:  We automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with the high-priority prospects, intelligently selecting the optimal channel for the specific prospect     \u2705 Progress so far In just 3 months, we have:  Released the 1st and 2nd iteration of the product to 15 advisory firms. Grown revenue by >11x MoM. Got 70 firms to join our waitlist, without any acquisition efforts or outbound. Won Morningstar\u2019s Fintech Showcase last month. Have been getting some buzz! Here and here.    \u2753One Ask for You (If you made it this far) If you ever thought about working with a financial advisor, evaluated one, currently work with one (or want to get matched with one \ud83d\ude09), we\u2019d love to talk to you. Book 15 min with us here. If you\u2019re in SF, we\u2019ll buy you a coffee. If not, let\u2019s call it an IOU. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "FINNY's AI-driven platform for financial advisors presents a compelling opportunity in Latin America, but requires careful adaptation.  The market size for financial advisors is significant, especially considering the growing middle class and increasing wealth in several countries. However, the level of digital adoption and financial literacy varies greatly across the region.  Cultural nuances in business relationships and communication styles must be considered.  Economic factors, such as disposable income and investment habits, will influence the target audience and pricing strategy.  Furthermore, regulatory compliance in different Latin American countries is a crucial consideration.  Success hinges on localization, building trust within a market where personal relationships are paramount, and potentially offering tiered pricing to accommodate varying levels of advisor resources.",

        "mvp": "The MVP should focus on a single Latin American country with a relatively high level of digital adoption and financial market development (e.g., Mexico, Colombia, Chile).  This MVP should prioritize a streamlined version of the prospect identification and prioritization features. Instead of a full multi-channel outreach automation, the MVP should concentrate on providing prioritized prospect lists and detailed profiles, allowing advisors to maintain control over the outreach and relationship-building process.  This initial phase prioritizes building trust and demonstrating value through accurate prospect identification and prioritization before tackling complex automation.  Data integration with local financial databases and adapting the AI models to the specific demographics and investment behaviors within the chosen country is crucial for success.  User feedback and iterative improvement based on early adopter experience will be essential."

With 30+ open-source metrics, synthetic test-set generators, and online monitoring tools, we help AI app developers achieve a high degree of reliability in mission-critical use cases such as compliance copilot, enterprise search, financial assistance, etc. \u2b50 Meet the Relari Team Hi everyone, Yi and Pasquale from Relari here. We both spent years building safety-critical AI applications, particularly in autonomous driving and robotics. Pasquale has a PhD from MIT where he researched fault detection in complex AI systems. Yi has an MBA from Harvard and led multiple AI products from concept to production including robo-taxis, self-driving trucks, and warehouse robots.  \ud83d\udca1 Our Inspiration: Autonomous Vehicles Just like autonomous vehicles promise to change how we move, GenAI applications promise to revolutionize the way we work. However, ensuring these systems are safe and reliable requires a shift in the development process. Autonomous vehicles need to drive billions of miles to ensure that they are safer than human drivers. This would take decades, so the industry relies on simulation and synthetic data to efficiently test and validate each iteration of the self-driving software stack. We see a strong parallel in the world of GenAI. At Relari.ai, we are building towards a future where a similar infrastructure will enable complex and powerful applications based on large language models (LLMs). \ud83d\udd34 Problem: GenAI Apps are Unreliable LLM-based applications can be inconsistent and unreliable. This blocks GenAI\u2019s adoption in mission-critical workflows and hurts user confidence and retention once deployed to production. Good testing infrastructure is paramount to achieving the quality users demand, but GenAI app developers across startups and enterprises struggle to define the right set of tests and quality-control standards for deployment. The main challenges the AI teams face are:  Complex Pipelines: GenAI pipelines are getting increasingly more complex and it is often difficult to pinpoint where problems originate. Gap from Evaluation to Reality: There is a huge gap between the metrics used in offline evaluation and user feedback, leading to distrust in offline evaluation results. Lack of Relevant Datasets: Public datasets are overfitted by models and often not relevant to specific applications. However, manual curation of custom datasets is extremely time-consuming and costly.  \ud83d\ude80 Solution: Harden AI Systems with Simulation Relari offers a complete testing and simulation stack for GenAI pipelines designed to directly address the problems above.

How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.I\u2019ve been working on it since July 4th, which is less than 2 months. During this period, I\u2019ve spent at least a few weeks completely immersed in building Manicode at ~80 hours per week. I\u2019ve also been juggling responsibilities at Manifold, including interviewing many candidates for a backend engineer position, keeping up 1:1\u2019s with my reports, and attending daily standup to guide the company. What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.Manicode is your coding assistant: run manicode in your terminal in your project directory, ask it to do any coding task, and it will make changes to your files. ...and it will do a really good job. Why?  It has full access to read and write to your files, run terminal commands, and scrape the web  It can grab files it needs for context, edit multiple files at once (no copy-pasting), run the type checker, run tests, install dependencies, and search for documentation. These abilities are key to doing the best job and will only become more powerful as LLM's continue to level up.  It uses so-called \"knowledge\" files  LLM's perform so much better with extra context! With Manicode, we've come up with this idea to check in knowledge.md files in any directory, and write down extra bits of context, like which 3 files you need to edit in order to create a new endpoint. Or which patterns are being deprecated and which should be used. Or which directories can import from other directories. Every codebase has lots of implicit knowledge like this that you have to impart to your engineers. Once written down, it makes Claude really fly! It's truly a night and day difference.  It's synchronous, and you can give feedback  You're chatting with it. It takes ~30 seconds to get back to you and then you can tell it what you want to do next or what it did wrong. This keeps Manicode on track and aligned.  It learns  The flow of using Manicode is: Ask it to do something If it fails, point out its error Manicode fixes the error and automatically writes down how it can improve for next time in a knowledge file You push the commit, and now Manicode has become even more capable when the next engineer runs it in the codebase. This is the magic loop that will make Manicode productive for experienced engineers in giant codebases.  We're unafraid to spend for better results  We can use as many parallel API calls with as much context as we can to produce the best code, because we know that the alternative is human labor, which is much more expensive.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Codebuff, a CLI coding assistant, faces a challenging but potentially rewarding path in the Latin American market.  The market size for developer tools is growing, but it's smaller than consumer markets.  The high price point ($99/month) is a significant barrier, especially considering the prevalent use of free or low-cost alternatives among individual developers in the region.  Cultural nuances are less of a direct concern since the product is developer-focused and transcends language barriers to a significant degree; however, widespread adoption depends on the level of English proficiency among the target developers.  Economic factors will heavily influence adoption.  Focusing on companies rather than individual developers could mitigate the price sensitivity, but this narrows the market.  Successful implementation requires a strong marketing strategy targeting specific segments of the developer community in Latin America and potentially offering tiered pricing models for individuals or teams, coupled with strategic partnerships to integrate with popular IDEs used in the region.",

We are building a foundation model, from the ground up, trained on a massive and diverse corpus of brainwave data i.e. Electroencephalography (EEG). In other words, similar to how Large Language Models (LLM) are trained on human language ie. text, our model is trained on brain language ie. brainwaves. Our foundation model will be able to understand and detect the many facets of brain activity, from disease to wellbeing. Crucially, similar to how ChatGPT can be fine-tuned to become a lawyer or a python developer, our brain foundation model will easily be fine-tuned to become a neurologist co-pilot or a biomarker discovery assistant. And, this is only our first milestone - more on this below.  The opportunity Our brain foundation model will address a variety of use cases with minimal training, such as:  Diagnosis of a vast majority of neurological conditions. Drug and biomarker discovery in clinical trials. Remote monitoring of brainwave abnormalities, e.g., treatment response to drugs or sleep irregularities. Real-time tracking of brain health, such as cognition or head injuries, measured through helmets in sports and military. Empowering devices such as Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest to translate brain signals into everyday actions.  Why are we starting with neurological conditions? During his PhD at London's St Thomas' EEG department, Dimitris discovered a key insight: EEG is a crucial test for neurological disorders, but its manual review process is both slow and error-prone. Specifically:  Neurologists manually inspect the EEG brainwaves to identify abnormal patterns. This can lead to a 30% margin of error and crucially misdiagnoses. There is a substantial rise of EEG data being collected, due to the deployment of\u00a0 remote EEG devices. Despite these remote devices continuously recording patients at home, there is no way to review this enormous and continuous stream of incoming data. Conversely to the upward EEG data trend, there is an extreme shortage of neurologists leading to wait times lasting several months.  Our first product Our first product is a copilot for epilepsy diagnosis. The product, which is powered by our brain foundation model, will assist neurologists by obtaining diagnostic insights around a patient\u2019s EEG, in real time. This approach cuts down the time to review EEG from hours to seconds. Additionally, our standardized EEG analysis reduces the margin of error from manual inspection, which in many cases leads to misdiagnosis and recurrent hospital visits. Shortly after epilepsy, we will fine tune our foundation model to provide diagnosis for a vast majority of other conditions such as sleep and cognitive disorders. Who we are We are Dimitris and Kris. Dimitris has a PhD in neuroscience and AI, and has been working on EEG for 12 years, but also shipped production level AI as a deep learning lead at IQVIA. Kris has a product background, building healthcare and AI products across Google and Spotify. We are both avid musicians and love punk rock. Our ask.. We are looking for intros to:  Neurologists, sleep doctors, neurotech companies, or companies in clinical trials in order to sign LOIs. We can automate the analysis of the brainwave (EEG) data at a fraction of their current cost. Academic or healthcare institutions that store EEG data. In exchange for accessing their EEG records, we will provide our model for free for research purposes.  You can send them our way to info@piramidal.ai!

The large and growing population provides a substantial market. However, several factors need consideration.  Firstly, the high cost of specialized medical equipment (EEG devices) and the digital divide could limit market penetration in less developed areas. Secondly, cultural factors regarding technology adoption and trust in AI-driven diagnoses need to be addressed through targeted marketing and educational campaigns.  Furthermore, regulatory hurdles related to medical device approval and data privacy (GDPR equivalent in Latin American countries) must be navigated carefully.

        "feasibility_analysis": "The feasibility of introducing a home personal robot like Isaac in the Latin American market presents significant challenges.  While there's potential demand among higher-income households, the market size is considerably smaller compared to developed nations.  High initial costs ($1000 reservation) would limit accessibility to a niche segment.  Cultural nuances regarding technology adoption and trust in autonomous systems also need careful consideration.  Economic factors like fluctuating exchange rates and varying levels of disposable income across Latin American countries should be analyzed.  Infrastructure limitations, particularly reliable internet access in some regions, could hinder the robot's functionality, especially features relying on remote operation and data transfer.  Furthermore,  after-sales service and technical support infrastructure would need robust development to succeed.",

        "mvp": "Instead of launching with a fully functional robot, a strong MVP would involve developing a simplified, less expensive version focusing on a single core function, like autonomous cleaning or laundry folding, targeting a smaller, more affluent demographic in a single, technologically advanced Latin American city (e.g., Santiago, Chile, or Buenos Aires, Argentina).  This MVP should prioritize data collection to assess real-world performance and customer feedback within the specific cultural context.  This approach minimizes technical complexity and financial risks while gathering crucial data for future iterations.  The MVP should also address language localization and potential integration with locally popular smart home platforms."

I have experience in operational excellence, business development, compliance, and deep understanding of AI, NLP, and Hardware. Ares Industries is focused on building the next generation of smart munitions.Devan PlantamuraAres Industries\u00a0Company LaunchesAres Industries - Building low-cost cruise missiles \ud83d\ude80 Hello, we\u2019re Alex and Devan, and we\u2019re building the low-cost cruise missiles the United States needs! What we\u2019re building Ares is building a new class of anti-ship cruise missiles. We are going to deliver the capabilities that the DoD wants in a form factor that\u2019s 10x smaller and 10x cheaper. Our missiles will be compatible with existing launch platforms, deliver smaller payloads at high subsonic speeds, and take out ships hundreds of miles away. We\u2019re focusing on ground and ship-launched variants to start but will expand into air-launched versions, as well as versions with extended ranges and different payloads. Why we\u2019re doing this A war with China in the Taiwan Strait would look nothing like what we've seen in Ukraine or the Middle East. Wargames within DoD and military experts are in agreement that the most useful weapons in such a conflict would be long range anti-ship weapons or cruise missiles. The United States is not adequately prepared. In a potential conflict, our stockpiles will run out in weeks, and we currently don\u2019t have the industrial capacity to build at a rate that could win a war, much less deter China. Higher-ups in DoD are waking up to the problem, and generals such as Major General Cameron Holt and officials such as Chairman of the House Select Committee on China Mike Gallagher have echoed this sentiment. Recent conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have shown that our weapons are too large, too expensive for the wars of today. Existing anti-ship cruise missiles are low-volume, multi-million dollar, 3,000 lb behemoths meant to take out large cruisers and destroyers. But Chinese shipbuilding capability is far superior to ours, and we can\u2019t make enough anti-ship missiles to counter. In addition, huge missiles aren\u2019t needed to take out the smaller corvettes and frigates that make up the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy. And $3M missiles make even less sense to take out swarms of $200k small, unmanned surface vessels. The DoD needs smaller, less expensive cruise missiles, and lots of them! But no one has delivered on that promise yet. How we know how to do this Both of us have worked at multiple defense and munitions startups.\u00a0Devan is an Army Psychological Operations and Navy combat veteran and has deep experience in operations and business development at well-funded defense startups.\u00a0Alex was the first engineering hire at an earlier missile startup, built autonomous systems at Rivian and Stanford, and worked on turbojets at CSULB. Where we\u2019re at now We spent the summer building multiple prototypes and flight-testing them in the Mojave. In 11 weeks, we went from starting the company to flight testing with our own design. We are on track to deliver early working missile systems to our first customers by mid-2025. We believe our vision for anti-ship cruise missiles can help fill the munitions gap that the US faces. At Ares, we would never wish for a war to occur. But by helping to rebuild our defense industrial base, we can make sure the United States is prepared to stop a conflict and save countless lives. Our Ask We are looking for extremely talented aerospace engineers to help bring our prototypes to fruition. If you know any aerodynamics, propulsion, or GNC engineers who are interested in building something incredibly cool and want to make a positive difference in geopolitics, please send them our way!  ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "The development and sale of low-cost cruise missiles in the Latin American market is highly infeasible.  The target market (US DoD) is completely outside Latin America.  The technology is extremely specialized, requiring a high level of technical expertise and significant capital investment, far beyond the reach of most Latin American countries. The regulatory hurdles for manufacturing and selling such weaponry would be immense and likely insurmountable for a startup, especially given the sensitive nature of military technology and international arms trade regulations.  There is no existing market in Latin America for this product, and cultural and economic factors make it completely unviable.",

(data)  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the $100 billion spot freight market. Existing solutions don\u2019t work well for medium and large Carriers. The spot freight market is fragmented across hundreds of load boards, thousands of brokers, and millions of shippers. For medium and large carriers, this fragmentation creates a logistical nightmare. Finding a single spot freight shipment requires a dispatcher to manually login, filter and compare each load against their fleet and availability. Sorting through thousands of emails, multiple load boards and making many time consuming phone calls. The result? Dispatchers go the path of least resistance - large public load boards. They can\u2019t take advantage of the much higher value, shipper direct freight because it\u2019s physically impossible to sort through them all every day. These public load boards take an 18-30% cut of the shipment price that otherwise could have gone to the carrier. For the average medium-sized carrier doing 50 spot loads a week, this represents almost $500,000 in lost yearly revenue (2,600 shipments x $700 \u00d7 24% = $462,280). The Manifold Solution Manifold solves this problem by aggregating all available spot freight opportunities, including shipper direct spot freight, into one single dashboard. Finding and bidding on quality shipper direct freight is easier with Manifold than finding low quality loads on DAT, the current industry standard.  Asks If you have connections in the freight industry; whether they be Carriers, Brokers, or Shippers. Send them our way! We talk freight in our spare time and love it.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Manifold's model, while successful in the US market, faces significant challenges adapting to the Latin American context.  The fragmented and often less digitally mature logistics infrastructure in many Hispanic countries presents a hurdle.  Market size for large asset-based carriers might be smaller than in the US, requiring a go-to-market strategy focusing on specific, high-growth regions. Cultural nuances regarding trust and business relationships also need consideration; personal connections might play a more significant role than solely relying on a digital platform.  Economic factors like fluctuating fuel prices and varying levels of digital adoption across different countries must be carefully analyzed.  A successful implementation would need a phased rollout, initially concentrating on countries with better digital infrastructure and a higher concentration of larger trucking companies.",

Develop a simplified MVP with core functionalities: aggregating spot freight opportunities from a limited number of sources, providing a user-friendly dashboard for carriers to view and bid on loads, and incorporating basic communication features.  Prioritize Spanish language support and culturally relevant features.  The MVP should focus on establishing trust and demonstrating value through case studies showcasing increased revenue and efficiency for participating carriers. Secure partnerships with a few key carriers in the target market to build initial user base and gather critical feedback for iterative development."

It delivers personalized advice, proactive insights, and activities to deepen connections. Ready to transform your relationship? Download the app with your partner today! Hi, we\u2019re Claire and Ralph, the team behind Maia. Our mission is to empower couples to build stronger, more fulfilling relationships. With Maia, we're making personalized relationship coaching accessible to everyone, at any time.  \ud83e\udd14 The Problem Despite the pivotal role relationships play in our happiness and overall well-being, existing support systems fall short. Traditional couples therapy is still inaccessible and stigmatized, couples are increasingly turning online for advice, and couple apps provide static content that lacks personalization. On average, it takes a couple 6 years of being unhappy before seeking help. We're to navigate the complexities of building lasting relationships largely on our own, using trial and error and the hope that love will find a way (divorce rates are >50%). \ud83d\udca1 Our Solution  Maia reimagines relationship care by blending AI coaching, expert guidance, and informal chat interactions into a seamless, engaging experience for couples. Building a lasting relationship is about more than just maintenance; it\u2019s also about turning your relationship into a rewarding adventure. With Maia, personal growth and wellness become accessible and enjoyable for every couple. Whether it's planning the perfect date night, resolving a conflict, or learning more about one another, Maia offers a roadmap to a happier, healthier relationship. Here\u2019s what Dr. Marisa T. Cohen, PhD, LMFT, our relationship expert, says about Maia:  Maia is a powerful tool that provides psychoeducation about relationships, normalizes the experiences we have and challenges we face, as well as prompts users to reflect on their lived experiences, values, and goals, thereby encouraging a greater level of self-awareness. The best part is that engaging with Maia feels like chatting with a friend, one that not only has deep understanding of the human connection, but also a lot of sass. I am proud to work with the Maia team in training Maia to approach users from a place of curiosity like a clinician, present tips and valuable resources like a relationship expert, and engage with users from a place of deep appreciation of the human bond.  Here\u2019s what our user K. said about Maia:  I am beyond grateful I came across it. I\u2019ve been recommending it to friends along the way as it\u2019s helped immensely as a support outlet but also grow my thoughts when I fall narrow minded from an emotional state.\u00a0I\u2019ve personally found it to be far better than messaging-therapist platforms because of the lack of opinions and bias. I think that\u2019s probably a major difference that pushes me to truly absorb the advice Maia gives.  \ud83d\udcd6 Our Story For us, Maia\u2019s mission is deeply personal. Having both grown up in first-generation divorced households and navigated the ups and downs of our own relationships, we recognized the universal need for a proactive approach to relationship health. By combining our expertise in AI and psychology, we built Maia to address this need. \ud83d\ude4c Our Ask  Couples! We made Maia for you!

Fabricate lets them instantly create engineering drawings for their parts, saving them up to 40 hours every month by doing the tedious work for them. Product Video   The Problem Engineering drawings are required for every manufactured part, but creating them is tedious and time-consuming. For large industrial projects with thousands of parts, engineers spend countless valuable hours on drawings instead of designing new parts.

        "feasibility_analysis": "Fabricate faces a significant challenge in the Latin American market. While the need for efficient procurement and engineering drawing solutions exists, the target audience (hardware engineers in established companies) is relatively small compared to other software markets.  The market is further segmented by varying levels of technological adoption and digitalization across different Latin American countries. Economic factors also play a role; smaller companies might prioritize cost-cutting over sophisticated software solutions.  Cultural nuances are less of a direct factor, but successful implementation would necessitate adapting the platform's communication and support materials to local Spanish dialects and technical terminology.

Andrew graduated from Princeton, where he majored in Operations Research & Financial Engineering (ORFE) and met Grant.Andrew WangGoldenBasis\u00a0Company LaunchesGoldenBasis - Modern back-office software for brokeragesTLDR; GoldenBasis makes it easy for brokerages (think Schwab or Fidelity) to run their back office with modern software, and we\u2019re starting with investment account transfers. For example, when you want to transfer your stocks from Schwab to Fidelity, GoldenBasis would let Fidelity gather your transfer information, track the status of your transfer, and automatically update their internal records. Ask If you or someone you know is leading a brokerage operations team and wants to improve their account transfer process, please reach out at founders@goldenbasis.com! A quick primer on account transfers  Account transfers exist so you can move to a new brokerage without selling your positions, which could incur taxes. Incoming account transfers are a primary source of growth for brokerages. Over $90 billion of assets are transferred every month in the US. Surprisingly, 18% of these transfers are delayed, often for several weeks [1].  How the process works Let\u2019s say you want to transfer your assets from Schwab to Fidelity. The following needs to happen:  You fill out an account transfer form at Fidelity. Fidelity sends this information to Schwab. Schwab tells Fidelity what assets are in your account. Fidelity makes sure they can hold these assets. Your assets move to Fidelity a few days later.  This back-and-forth process is part of a standard protocol called ACATS, and it lets brokerages transfer assets to each other electronically [2]. The process above sounds straightforward, but there are hundreds of edge cases detailed in manuals that total over 1000 pages. Problem Transfers are supposed to take 3-4 days but often take weeks. During the transfer:  You can\u2019t trade your assets. To find out the status of your transfer, you need to contact customer support. The brokerage receiving your assets is missing out on revenue. The brokerage delivering your assets gets in trouble with the regulators if they don\u2019t go quickly enough.  Why are delays so common? It\u2019s because there are multiple rounds of manual data entry and any small mistake (e.g. missing comma) can delay the transfer. Furthermore, the operations team has to resolve issues on outdated platforms that are hard to use. Here\u2019s a taste of the experience today:   You begin the transfer by filling out a daunting form.    The brokerage operations team re-enters your form and handles issues in a back-office system.    Solution GoldenBasis provides a modern software stack that solves these issues:   With GoldenBasis, you don\u2019t need to fill out any forms. Just upload your account statement from the brokerage you want to leave, and our AI extracts and validates the fields, which vastly reduces errors.    GoldenBasis lets you easily track the status of your transfer so you know what\u2019s going on without having to contact support.    GoldenBasis provides modern GUIs for the operations team to handle issues.    Team  Grant (CEO) met Andrew (CTO) in college at Princeton, where they became best friends. In fact, Andrew was the best man at Grant\u2019s wedding. They teamed up to take on their biggest adventure yet: building a startup and reading a couple thousand pages of manuals along the way. Before GoldenBasis, Grant worked at Altruist, where he discovered the outdated technology that was causing so much pain for brokerage back offices. He also led Altruist\u2019s integration of SSG post-acquisition, which made Altruist the third-largest custodian for financial advisors, behind Charles Schwab and Fidelity. Before that, Grant helped grow Princeton\u2019s endowment from $26.1 billion to $37.7 billion as a member of the 20-person investment staff. Before GoldenBasis, Andrew did quant research and software engineering at Citadel, where he built trading systems that process billions of dollars per day. Before that, he worked at Bridgewater, where he wrote software to model global economies and trade fixed-income securities. Andrew loved the prospect of bringing legacy systems to the modern age, especially the back office since it\u2019s so often neglected.

While the US market is the initial focus, the Latin American market presents both opportunities and challenges.  The market size is considerable, with growing numbers of high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors.  However, the adoption of sophisticated back-office software might be slower due to varying levels of technological infrastructure and digital literacy across different countries.

Historically, sellers pay a 3% commission to the buyer's agent. However, due to a recent lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, buyers will soon have to pay their agents themselves, which can be very expensive (i.e., $30,000 for a $1 million house).  With tools like Zillow, finding the right house at the right price is easier than ever. However, buying a house still requires an agent, even though buyers are doing most of the work themselves. Modern Realty changes this by offering an AI self-service solution. Modern Realty guides you through buying a home step-by-step. You can start with or without a specific home in mind. On the website, you can schedule in-person showings and use tools to help you determine how much to offer. When you're ready, you can create and submit an offer through our platform. Using the software is free; we only charge if you successfully buy a house. Plus, if you need more help, our team of lawyers and real estate agents are always available to guide you through the process. How it works \ud83e\udde0 At Modern Realty, we provide everything you need to make the best, most informed home-buying decision.

Between us, we have had the opportunity to work at Google Research, Microsoft, Amazon, Stanford AI Lab (SAIL), and Berkeley AI Research (BAIR). Both of us have worked a lot with self-driving cars and LLMs during our university days and are stoked to be working at the intersection of both fields. Why are we building this? \u2699\ufe0f We were active users of various AI coding tools even before they were named \u201cpair programmers\u201d. However, the experience was underwhelming because:  they are not really \u201cintelligent\u201d: we always had to type out multiple shortcuts for our queries to be routed to the right AI agent to handle. when we were deeply immersed in a task/implementation, we often didn\u2019t know how, or what to ask the AI Coding tool. For example, when implementing a button that triggers a POST/ request to the backend API, we have to constantly jump around multiple files, making modifications across different functions. In this scenario, before asking the AI to help us with implementation, we actually have to spend time thinking about \u201chow\u201d to frame our questions:    How do we explain what the functionality of this button is? Which file names should we mention to the AI as being relevant? How can we succinctly phrase all relevant context, including current progress or past edits/changes that we have made, so that the AI will give us the best output?  As a result, we often resorted to doing everything ourselves to avoid the tedious back-and-forth. In those moments, we realized what we wanted was a tool that could fetch global context without relying on shortcut commands, anticipate our needs, and even understand what we were thinking before typing anything\u2014 something that was always \u201con the same page\u201d with us.

Those time entries are then used to generate client bills, which partners spend hours reviewing before they\u2019re sent out. This process is time consuming and error-prone, resulting in:  Lost revenue: ~10% of billable time slips through the cracks Wasted time: Lawyers spend 30 mins/day tracking time and partners spend 10+ hours/month preparing client bills Stress and burnout: 87% of lawyers say they find time tracking painful Poor quality: Inconsistent time entries result in client complaints  The Solution \u2728 PointOne completely automates the process of time tracking. Our application captures the work done on a lawyer\u2019s laptop and mobile phone, uses AI to interpret the tasks, and generates time entries that are used to bill the client. These time entries are customized firm-by-firm and client-by-client to fit their specific billing preferences. This allows firms to:  Capture 10% more billable time Free lawyers from the burden of daily time tracking Get timesheets submitted daily instead of weekly or monthly Get consistently formatted entries that meet firm and client preferences  Coming soon, we\u2019ll be releasing a billing copilot for partners that will cut down on bill review time by taking a first pass at redlining client bills. Why we built PointOne \ud83d\udcbc Adrian was a corporate lawyer at Fenwick & West, doing financings and acquisitions for companies like Robinhood, Stripe, Upwork, and SentinelOne. He was chronically delinquent in submitting his timesheets and nearly lost his bonus on multiple occasions as a result. He teamed up with Katon and Jeremy, software engineers from Applied Intuition and Google who had worked previously in legal tech and ML and were excited to tackle this challenge. The Opportunity \ud83d\udcc8 Time tracking and billing are just the beginning \u2013 there are many other ways that timekeeping data can deliver value for firms. For example, we can help firms better predict how long new projects will take, enabling them to price fixed fee work more accurately. The data can also be used for staffing and workflow allocation decisions. Our ask \ud83d\udc4b If you work at a law firm, book a call to discuss how we can help your firm If not, please introduce us to any lawyers you know! Most lawyers we talk to hate timekeeping but don\u2019t realize it can be automated. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "PointOne's automated time tracking and billing solution presents a compelling opportunity within the Latin American legal market, but requires careful consideration.  Market size is significant, as many large and small law firms in the region still rely on manual processes. However, the adoption rate will depend on factors like technological infrastructure and willingness to adopt AI-driven solutions. Cultural nuances, specifically the level of trust in AI-based automation for legal billing, will influence adoption.  Economic factors are key; the pricing model needs to be competitive and accessible for firms of varying sizes.  A phased rollout targeting larger firms with better technological infrastructure in major cities might be more effective initially.  Success depends heavily on strong local partnerships and localized marketing that addresses specific concerns of Latin American lawyers.",

Building software products since I was in high school.Alessandro VecchiSorcerer\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesSorcerer - Weather balloons that collect 1000x more data Hey YC! We\u2019re Max, Alex, and Austin, the team behind Sorcerer. The problem & background Hundreds of terabytes of weather data are collected from satellites, ground stations, airplanes, and weather balloons every day. In-situ weather observation has the most impact on weather models, but it\u2019s incredibly expensive to collect. The US National Weather Service spends over a billion dollars annually just on its network of weather balloons, stations, and aircraft sensors. Despite this cost, there are still places in the US where we don't know what the temperature will be two days from now. And for the 80% of the world that lacks any weather infrastructure? There\u2019s always the weather rock. The solution We\u2019re launching a global network of persistent weather balloons to provide real-time data in previously unreachable locations. Each balloon remains airborne for over six months, completing ~30 laps around the globe while navigating between sea level and 65,000 feet. We\u2019re able to collect 1000x more data per dollar than current systems, and we use this unique data to train AI weather models that are up to 50% more accurate than today\u2019s best forecasts. https://youtu.be/F_Di8cjaEUY   The Team As founding engineer at aerospace startup Urban Sky, Max developed the world\u2019s first stratospheric ballooning systems for high-resolution imaging and wildfire tracking. As employee number three at Urban Sky, Alex built their mission control and flight prediction engine from the ground up (\u201cthe best in the world\u201d - US Secretary of Defense). Austin was an ultralight flight instructor before he could legally drive and was most recently Head of Product at SumUp, shipping highly regulated hardware at scale. How You Can Help  Industry intros: We\u2019d love to talk with aerospace, commercial aviation, ocean freight, logistics, and commodities trading execs (these folks think weather data is pretty neat) If you find one of our balloons near SF: Sorry! It\u2019s still a work in progress (and please get it back to us)  We\u2019d also love to hear from you! Reach out any time at austin@sorcerer.earth Best, Max, Alex, & Austin   Company PhotoHear from the foundersWhat is the core problem you are solving? Why is this a big problem? What made you decide to work on it?Hundreds of terabytes of weather data are collected from satellites, ground stations, airplanes and weather balloons every day. A typical weather satellite costs more than $100 million to launch, and the US National Weather Service spends over a billion dollars a year\u00a0just on its sparse network of weather balloon stations. A small handful of organizations then pipe that data into billion-dollar supercomputers to run the world\u2019s most expensive physics simulations four times a day. Despite this cost, there are still places in the US\u00a0where we don't know what the temperature is going to be two days from now. And for the rest of the world that lacks adequate weather infrastructure? There\u2019s always the\u00a0weather rock. AI models are upending the expensive physics simulations. These models are more accurate, running at higher resolutions for a fraction of the cost. But, like most AIs, weather models are hungry for\u00a0data,\u00a0and the reality is that most of the world isn\u2019t covered despite the costly infrastructure.This is because\u00a0direct\u00a0observation (as opposed to satellite observation) is both incredibly impactful but also incredibly expensive. This cost leaves\u00a0most of the Earth without in-situ observations. Oceans have especially poor coverage, and no matter how good your model is, you still need to know what\u2019s happening over the Pacific today to predict the weather in SF tomorrow. Sorcerer is deploying a global network of low-cost, persistent weather drones to provide real-time data in previously unreachable locations. Our system collects 30x more observations than the entire global observation infrastructure at 1% the cost. We use this data to train a weather model that\u2019s already competitive with best-in-class traditional weather prediction, while being 10,000x cheaper. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Sorcerer's technology, while innovative, faces significant challenges in the Latin American market.  The high initial investment required for manufacturing and deploying weather balloons, coupled with the need for specialized technical expertise, presents a considerable hurdle.  Market size for this technology in Latin America is limited compared to developed nations with robust meteorological infrastructure needs.  While some countries might benefit from improved weather forecasting (e.g., for agriculture), the overall market demand may not justify the substantial upfront investment. Cultural nuances are less of a direct factor, but successful implementation will depend heavily on building trust with government agencies or private sector clients who may be hesitant to adopt a novel technology.  Economic factors, like foreign exchange volatility and potentially limited government funding for research and development, must also be considered.

Get started now at https://outerport.com! \u274c The Problem Horizontal scaling of LLM inference is difficult. Preparing a server for LLM inference roughly involves the following steps:  Downloading a model (usually big, like 10s of GBs!) Moving the model from disk to RAM Moving the model from RAM to GPU memory  When implemented naively, just these 3 steps can take around ~4 minutes for a small 7B parameter LLM. To optimize this, you need to implement things like model chunking, parallel downloads, network streaming into memory, and use local SSDs. Even after doing all of this, model loading can take upwards of ~30 seconds, a long time to keep impatient customers waiting. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Outerport Outerport achieves a\u00a0~2 second\u00a0model load time by keeping models warm in a pinned memory cache daemon, with predictive orchestration to figure out where & when to keep models warm.

Arda\u2019s obsession with deep learning for biomolecular design began when the original AlphaFold paper was released.       \u274c The problem: (1) The $6 trillion chemicals industry is flawed:  This industry produces 20% of industrial greenhouse gases and is responsible for 15% of global energy usage. Traditional chemical manufacturing relies on hazardous materials and produces huge amounts of waste, resulting in high costs. You unknowingly contribute to this problem by personally using ~160 of these chemicals daily.  (2) Enzymes offer an amazing solution, but they are hard to develop  Enzymes are biological catalysts. They accelerate reactions at mild temperatures and pressures, making chemical manufacturing cheaper, faster, and more sustainable. Major pharmaceutical companies already use enzymes for manufacturing a limited number of drugs but developing them costs tens of millions of dollars and takes multiple years. Current enzyme engineering approaches are limited because they must start from an enzyme that already exists. No models currently understand the principles of catalysis, resulting in a narrow range of possible reactions that can be catalysed.  \u2705 Our Solution: Enzymes Designed From Scratch  We are building foundational enzyme design models that learn from huge amounts of data to understand the principles of catalysis. The model generates structures capable of catalysing reactions directly from transition state models, meaning we will expand the number of reactions that can feasibly be accelerated using enzymes.

        "feasibility_analysis": "The application of humanoid robots for logistics automation in Latin America presents significant challenges. While the market for 3PL services is growing, the high cost of advanced robotics, coupled with the need for specialized infrastructure and skilled technicians (potentially requiring significant training investment), poses a considerable hurdle.  Many Latin American countries lack the robust technological infrastructure and readily available skilled workforce required for widespread deployment of such complex technology.  Cultural factors, such as potential workforce displacement concerns and initial resistance to automation, must also be considered. Focusing on specific high-growth, high-margin sectors within 3PL, initially in more developed Latin American countries like Chile, Colombia or Mexico, could be a more strategic starting point.",

This could involve piloting a system in a single, high-value 3PL warehouse in a developed Latin American country, potentially focusing on a specific task like sorting or palletizing, using simpler, less expensive robotic arms or automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This allows for a gradual introduction of automation, minimizing initial investment and technical risks. Data collected from this pilot can then be used to refine the solution and demonstrate its value proposition to larger 3PL clients."

        "feasibility_analysis": "Firebender presents a compelling opportunity within the Latin American market, particularly considering the growing number of Android developers and tech companies in the region.  However, success hinges on addressing specific challenges.  Market size for this niche (Android developers using IntelliJ in Spanish-speaking countries) is smaller than the global market, requiring a focused marketing strategy targeting Spanish-speaking developers through online communities, developer conferences (like those focused on Latin American developers), and partnerships with universities and coding bootcamps. Cultural nuances are less of a concern; technical documentation can be translated, and the core product functionality remains largely universal. Economic factors, such as developer salaries and budget constraints, will necessitate a strong emphasis on the free aspect of the tool, and a clear demonstration of its value proposition (time saved, increased productivity).  The success in the LATAM market will depend significantly on the adoption rate among Latin American developers, which may be slower if the product is not fully localized to the region's specific needs.

It enables cross-border Indian companies to conduct transactions and receive payments in local currencies. Additionally, Infinity offers an in-house treasury management solution, allowing businesses to earn yield on idle cash and mitigate FX risks. Hey everyone! We\u2019re Sourav and Sidharth and we're building a business banking platform for cross-border SMBs and Startups. In our past jobs, we worked as founders, wealth managers, growth hackers, and founding engineers at high-growth fintech startups.   \ud83e\udd14 Problem Business banking is difficult. More so if you are global. Cross-border payments pose several challenges due to the complexities involved in transferring funds across different countries and jurisdictions.  Global payments are expensive One of the more basic issues with FX transactions is the lack of transparency in terms of the cost to execute FX payments. These costs can include wire transfer fees, correspondent bank fees, currency conversion fees, and intermediary fees, among others. While existing market providers might stress that one factor is low (lower than that of a competitor), that same institution might have high fees in another area, offsetting those savings. In general for every dollar a business moves from the US to India, business loses 7%. Global payments are slow In the majority of instances, international bank transfers are facilitated via the SWIFT network. This network ensures the transmission of your payment to its intended recipient. Nevertheless, the path isn't always direct. Certain payments may be routed through intermediaries, often referred to as correspondent banks, akin to making multiple connecting flights before reaching your final destination. Generally speaking, international bank transfers will arrive within one to five working days. There\u2019s a compliance risk  Each transaction must be promptly reported to the Central Bank of India, accompanied by the correct invoice and purpose codes (of which there are numerous variations), sign-off from chartered accountants, etc. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in payment delays extending for months. And There\u2019s a FX risk The conversion rates between USD and INR are variable.  What you receive today may differ from what you get in five days. If a business converts USD to INR five days from now and the dollar weakens, it will incur losses. \ud83e\udd29 The Solution Introducing Infinity! Streamline global customers and suppliers\u2019 payments with local accounts. 1) Multiple local currency accounts - one platform: Easily send, hold, and receive funds in major currencies to facilitate transactions with overseas suppliers and customers. 2) Flat Fee - with zero FX markup: Be fully transparent about the charges you incur. Receive a comprehensive breakdown of fees before each transaction to avoid any surprises. 3) Fast, same-day international money transfer: Track your payment in real time. 4) Treasury service to hedge FX: Earn higher yields on idle cash without worrying about liquidity and underlying asset risk. 5) Instant remittance certificate: You move money. Infinity will take care of compliance.

Previously, Mike served as the VP & Chief Architect at 23andMe. Mike's tenure at 23andMe spanned a 15+ year category-defining journey from Series A through IPO and beyond. Prior to 23andMe, Mike was an early engineer at Salesforce.com and developed technology at Merrill Lynch. Mike holds a BS in CS from Cornell, a MS in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford, and multiple patents related to cloud computing, security, genetics, and machine learning.Mike PolcariHaplotype Labs\u00a0Company LaunchesHaplotype Labs - Personalized prevention using genetics and AIHi! I\u2019m Mike, founder of Haplotype Labs. At Haplotype Labs, we believe that more precise prevention and screening will lead to longer healthspan and lower healthcare costs.  We're building the HaploHub: a software platform that helps genetic testing labs, clinical trials, and prevention-focused medical practices to deploy AI models that use genetics to predict, detect, and prevent disease. I joined 23andMe after Series A and helped take it public after over 15 years as VP / Chief Architect. The technology that my team and I developed at 23andMe has delivered more genetic risk reports to more patients than any other in the world, but the translation to patient outcomes remains unsolved. At Haplotype Labs, we are working to close that gap and accelerate the translation of polygenic risk scores into improved healthspan for patients. We\u2019re building the tech I wish I\u2019d had at 23andMe and making it broadly available to the clinic. Precision Preventative Care Preventative care programs currently stratify patients into risk categories for various conditions based on imperfect but still useful risk factors like demographics and family history. Patient stratification allows a care provider to optimize the financial expense and negative side effects of any given prevention program. For example, people with a family history of colon cancer are typically screened more frequently. Driven by falling prices of sequencing and improved model power, preventative care is on the cusp of broadly adopting genetic risk models as a means to further personalize these prevention programs and extend healthspan.

        "feasibility_analysis": "HaploHub faces a complex market entry in Latin America. While the demand for advanced healthcare solutions is growing, the market is characterized by significant disparities in access to technology and healthcare infrastructure.  The high technical complexity of the platform, coupled with the need for robust data privacy and security measures compliant with local regulations (like GDPR equivalence in some countries), presents a major hurdle.  Furthermore, widespread adoption requires educating healthcare professionals and patients about the benefits of personalized genetic testing and its interpretation, which necessitates culturally sensitive marketing and outreach strategies.  Economic factors, including the affordability of genetic testing and the willingness of payers to cover the costs, are critical considerations.  Market size for this specialized SaaS offering will be limited compared to other, broader healthcare tech solutions.  Focusing initially on a few key markets with better infrastructure and higher adoption rates (e.g., parts of Mexico, Chile, Colombia) could be a more strategic approach.",

We prevent overstock and out-of-stock situations, allowing clients to eliminate waste, free up capital, and drive higher sales. Problem \ud83d\udcc9  Financial Loss: Retailers worldwide lose over $1.8 trillion annually due to poor inventory planning. This issue stems primarily from two main problems: overstock and out-of-stock. Outdated Practices: Retailers rely on outdated tools like Excel, causing inefficiencies, forecasting errors, and missed opportunities. Environmental Cost: Fashion is the 3rd most polluting industry due to massive overproduction: 73% of textiles are burned or landfilled which contributes to 900 million tons of CO2 annually.  In the world of retail, inventory planning can often feel like a guessing game. One of our prospects, a company with a whopping $250M in revenue, humorously encapsulated this challenge during a recent call:  I quickly review our data and then check my crystal ball to pull a number out of thin air.  This playful take highlights a serious issue: without the right tools for accurate demand forecasting, retail planners resort to guesswork.  Solution \ud83d\udcc8 Metreecs is an AI demand forecasting software for retailers. We analyze large sets of internal and external data to predict consumer demand. This helps our clients align their inventory with actual market trends, reducing overproduction, stockouts, and markdowns, all while automating 90% of manual tasks. Our demand forecasting models drive 3 different modules:  Buying: We ensure that our clients buy the right products, in the right quantities for the right locations. Reordering: We anticipate stockouts before they occur, and suggest product replenishments to prevent them. Rebalancing: We provide inventory reallocation suggestions to eliminate waste and meet customer demand.

We\u2019re starting by using LLMs to automate submitting prior authorization requests (and getting their approval) on behalf of providers.  What is Prior Authorization, and Why Should I Care? Prior authorization is a process by which physicians must justify their treatment plan of a patient to that patient\u2019s health insurance carrier as \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d Right now, medical groups employ a team (1 employee focused on prior authorizations per 1-5 physicians) to handle this process with insurance carriers manually. These teams are frequently operating over capacity; some of the practices we\u2019ve talked to are so backlogged that a request isn\u2019t even submitted until up to a week after a doctor\u2019s order is placed. Figure 1: 94% of Physicians Report Delayed Patient Care due to Prior Authorization (Source: American Medical Association Survey of 1,000 Doctors)  As you can imagine, insurance carriers are incentivized to delay and/or deny approval as much as they can. Some carriers are so egregious that they\u2019re incurring fines in the tens of millions for morbidly delaying the care of sick patients. A patient who is exhibiting signs of colon cancer definitely shouldn\u2019t have to wait months (or even days) for a colonoscopy.

        "feasibility_analysis": "The concept of underwater data centers presents significant challenges for implementation in the Latin American market. While the technology offers potential benefits like reduced energy consumption and costs, several factors hinder its feasibility.  Firstly, the significant capital investment required for research, development, deployment, and ongoing maintenance poses a major hurdle.  Latin America's infrastructure varies significantly across countries;  coastal areas with suitable depths and access for deployment are not uniformly available across all nations.  The technical expertise needed for building, deploying, and maintaining these complex systems is limited within the region.  Furthermore, regulatory and permitting processes for marine infrastructure projects can be lengthy and complex, varying substantially by country. The target market would likely be large multinational companies with a presence in Latin America. The potential for this in the region is limited considering local digital economies are not as established and do not necessarily have the need for massive data centers.

We\u2019re Tyler Lehman and Arthur Chi from OpenFoundry. We\u2019re building the fastest developer experience for building on open source AI. Imagine Hugging Face if it were built from the ground up for startups instead of ML researchers. Our first product (live on GitHub) is a command-line tool to deploy open source models onto your own cloud with a single line of code.  Here\u2019s a demo where we ship Microsoft\u2019s Phi-2 model to our cloud. A couple of lines of code to deploy, and in just minutes the server is ready for inference.   \ud83d\udd2e Open source AI is the future AI is the new layer in the tech stack. It\u2019s as big a shift as cloud and mobile were two decades ago. We believe open source AI will dominate this market. Open source is catching up to the competition, and there\u2019s a compelling business case for it: it\u2019s faster & cheaper for many use cases, it can be self-hosted, and it reduces platform risk. \u274c But there\u2019s a big problem: the developer experience is rough As great as open source models have become, the developer experience around them is bad. You have to cobble many components together and must trudge through poor documentation, flaky APIs, hacked-together solutions, and clunky cloud configs. All of this slows developers down. In contrast, closed source companies like OpenAI provide an easy developer platform that just works out of the box with almost zero effort. We\u2019ve talked to many startups who are interested in moving more of their workloads onto open source models, but they feel stuck with their expensive closed source solutions because it\u2019s so painful to switch. \u2705 We\u2019re solving this by making the experience effortless OpenFoundry makes working with open source AI awesome so that it\u2019s as easy to fine-tune, deploy, and scale products on open source models as it is on OpenAI.  With OpenFoundry, you\u2019ll be able to:  Ship to your cloud in just a few lines of code [We\u2019re starting here!] Find the best models, datasets, and practices for your use cases Prototype and fine-tune in minutes  Within the first week of launching we already have customers putting critical workloads into production with our first product. Several customers have even asked to invest in us, which we see as a clear sign that we\u2019re building something important that people want. \ud83d\udcaa We\u2019ve done this before We built developer tools and communities at our previous jobs! Prior to YC, Tyler built developer platforms for Instagram and WhatsApp that are used by more than a million developers.\u00a0Arthur built large-scale APIs at Slack for products used by more than 350K customers.  We\u2019ve spent the last several months building products with open source AI and know first-hand the challenges of getting everything to work together. We\u2019re excited to build a first-class developer experience to make building on AI faster. \ud83c\udfa4 Our ask We\u2019re excited to talk to more startups building with AI who are already using open source models or are interested in learning how to build on them!

He studied CS and AI at Georgia Tech.Shobhit SrivastavaSymphony\u00a0Company LaunchesSymphony - A Conversational AI Recruiter Symphony is a conversational AI recruiter that helps companies hire customer-facing roles, all while giving candidates a more enjoyable and supportive experience in the recruiting process. We free up 80% of recruiters' time and see time-to-fill drop to as low as 2 days, which avoids costly downtime. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6dJYCylNiY   Problem Recruiters are drowning. Candidates aren\u2019t happy. Recruiters / Talent acquisition managers have a mountain of admin/screening work to find the right talent quickly. They often get 100s or 1,000s of (mostly irrelevant) applications for each job opening. When recruiters are drowning, quality, experience, and speed suffer. Lack of quality talent can cause downtime and lost revenue. Candidates suffer because they lack transparency & speed, leading to a poor candidate experience.  Opportunity Customer-facing roles are the most underserved Our focus is on customer-facing roles (anyone that interacts with customers). This covers roles ranging from CSRs, customer success managers, and sales associates to healthcare professionals and maintenance & repair staff. They need a mix of technical knowledge, communication skills, and EQ to be effective in their roles, which today is assessed purely by humans in an HR pre-screen. This is the most underserved sector in the recruiting space, bogged down by antiquated tools and manual admin work. They\u2019re also the largest population of workers, making up 60% of jobs or ~100M people.  Solution Automate the recruiting process and free up valuable time We evaluate all inbound applications against the custom criteria for the role to surface the best matches. Our AI interviewer, Eve, then conducts live voice screening calls with top candidates - saving recruiters from spending their time on initial screens while removing human bias from the process. These 15-20 minute conversations bring resumes to life, highlighting important traits like communication skills and EQ (both of which are critical for customer-facing roles).  Candidates tell us they feel more comfortable talking with our voice AI interviewer than humans. They are less nervous and can more openly share their experiences. Symphony then handles all needed admin work, coordinating with hiring managers and candidates to schedule the next interview.  We integrate with all major ATS systems to make it easy for our customers to get started with us.  About the founders  We first met when Murtaza was Shobhit\u2019s RA freshman year at Georgia Tech (go Jackets!). We\u2019ve been friends for over 10 years and grew up just a few miles away from each other in Georgia. We left our startup jobs about a year ago. Murtaza was VP of growth at Tractable (high-growth Series E computer vision startup) and EM at McKinsey. Shobhit was a tech lead at Valon (Series B mortgage fintech). We both felt firsthand how recruiting was broken. After we researched the space more, we learned about the massive problems roles recruiting teams, especially for customer-facing roles. Reach out! If you\u2019re interested in driving a better candidate experience, hiring better talent faster, all with fewer resources - let us know! We\u2019d love to chat :).

Because the heart cannot pump efficiently, fluids buildup around the body. Fluid overload is the main driver behind patient symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, etc.) and hospitalizations. Our minimally invasive device leverages the body's innate fluid management system to offload trapped fluid and prevent subsequent rounds of buildup. The one-time procedure has sustained effect -- keeping patients healthier, happier, and out of the hospital.Selera MedicalFounded:2023Team Size:2Location:Mountain ViewGroup Partner:Surbhi Sarna\u00a0Active FoundersStacie Arechavala, FounderFounder & CEO of Selera Medical, developing paradigm-shifting technology for heart failure patient management.

Masters in biomedical engineering and engineering management from Duke.Stacie ArechavalaSelera Medical\u00a0Kevin Bui, FounderKevin is co-founder and CTO of Selera Medical, a medical device startup developing a minimally invasive therapy for congestive heart failure. Prior to this, he was an Innovation Fellow in the Stanford Byers Center for Biodesign. Kevin received his undergraduate bioengineering degree from Stanford and his PhD in bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania, where he conducted research at the intersection of robotics, stroke rehabilitation, and cognitive neuroscience.Kevin BuiSelera Medical\u00a0Company LaunchesSelera Medical: Disrupting the heart failure treatment paradigm \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25Selera is developing a device to treat fluid overload in heart failure patients with a one-time, minimally invasive procedure. Backstory \ud83d\udcd6 Hello! \ud83d\udc4b We (Stacie & Kevin) are engineers who met at Stanford Biodesign, where we shadowed clinical cases and identified unmet needs in hospitals across the Bay Area. We observed first-hand the limited and ineffective treatment options available to heart failure patients, which led to poor quality of life and frequent hospitalizations. With Kevin\u2019s Ph.D. in bioengineering, Stacie\u2019s medical device + ops/strategy industry experience, and a shared vision to improve healthcare outcomes, Selera was born.  Problem \ud83d\udc94 Over 6.5 million people in the US suffer from heart failure, which is when the heart can no longer pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body. As the disease progresses, symptoms get worse, quality of life tanks, and hospital time skyrockets. It\u2019s terrible for patients and their loved ones, as well as a huge burden to the healthcare system. Over 90% of symptoms and hospitalizations are driven by fluid buildup around the body (think: fluid in the lungs \u2192 patient can\u2019t breathe \u2192 hospital). Standard of care medications to manage fluid hasn\u2019t changed in over 60 years, have adverse side effects, require significant provider time, and become ineffective over time. As a result, patients are trapped in a cycle: fluid builds up, symptoms worsen, hospitalization, discharge, repeat. Post-hospitalization, the survival rate is similar to some stage 4 cancers \u2013 only 50% at 2 years \u2013 and reduces with each admission. Approach \ud83c\udfaf We are taking a brand new approach by harnessing the body\u2019s own fluid management mechanisms to remove excess fluid, alleviate symptoms, and reduce hospitalizations. With the heart not pumping blood as well as it should be, it causes backups in the blood vessels (like a highway when there\u2019s construction). This forces fluid with important nutrients to leak out (detour) into the interstitial space, which is the space between organs and tissues. Normally, this fluid is collected and brought back to the bloodstream by the lymphatic system (a parallel highway with roads all over the body). However, the lymphatic system is overwhelmed by the extra fluid produced in heart failure due to the backups (when Maps reroutes everyone and the seemingly better alternative also has traffic). Without any other way out, fluid is trapped in the interstitial space, leading to the symptoms behind hospitalizations, such as swelling and chest pain depending on where the fluid is stuck. Our technology \u2018untaps\u2019 the fluid stuck in the interstitial space by offloading the lymphatic system so that it can work more efficiently (like opening up more lanes to reduce traffic). With our one-time procedure, minimally invasive lymphatic offloading (MILO) provides long-term treatment and breaks the fluid overload hospitalization cycle for patients.  Connect \ud83e\udd1d We\u2019re looking to connect with cardiologists and interventional radiologists interested in partnering with us on product testing and future clinical trials.

Our AI broker  Screens through millions of SMBs using semantic search on dozens of data points to identify potential targets Automatically researches each one to ensure criteria match using custom AI web agents Crafts and sends hyper-personalized emails to maximize response rate  Since launching our closed beta two weeks ago, we have about a dozen buyers using OffDeal to source $10-50 million SMB acquisitions. \u274c Problem: Buying a small business takes 18-24 months The current process of finding a small business to buy is painstakingly slow and tedious. Today, buyers rely on a combination of expensive SMB databases (e.g. Grata, Sourcescrub) and manual research, often involving a makeshift \"deal team\" of unpaid interns and offshore assistants. This cobbled-together system creates a major bottleneck, typically allowing buyers to only assess 100-150 businesses per week (and that's considered good!). Since buyers usually need to go through ~10,000 businesses before finding \u201cthe one\u201d, the entire process becomes incredibly time-consuming, frustrating, and expensive. \u2728 Our Solution: AI Broker to find, diligence, and engage 10x more SMB targets Our AI broker acts much like a human M&A advisor would - it finds targets, diligences them, and then reaches out to them on your behalf. However, unlike a human, our AI broker is powered by proprietary recommendation engines and custom-built AI agents and can do this for thousands of companies at a time \ud83d\udc40 Here is how it works: Step 1. \ud83d\udd0ePreliminary target list Our AI screens through millions of SMBs on dozens of data points using LLM-powered semantic search to uncover off-market hidden gems that match your exact acquisition criteria.  Step 2. \ud83e\udde0 Offload tedious research Our web-enabled AI agents conduct automated diligence, vetting thousands of companies to deliver a precision-targeted shortlist in minutes, not days.  Step 3.\u26a1Automate personalized outreach Our AI uses dozens of data points to craft and send hundreds of hyper-personalized messages each week, helping you stand out from other buyers and fill your calendar with owner calls.  Our first customers To start we\u2019re focusing on \u201csearch funds\u201d. These are individuals (typically MBAs from top programs) who raise money from institutional investors to acquire a small business. This is an ideal first customer because:  They only have 2 years to find a business (or have to return capital) 30% of searchers fail to find a deal within that timeframe They are happy to pay finder fees for successful introductions Ori personally knows dozens of them from his time at HBS and working in finance, making for a much easier GTM \ud83d\ude42  Beyond search funds, we plan to expand to private equity firms, which buy thousands of SMBs each year, as well as to a rapidly growing number of individuals choosing to leave the rat race and pursue acquisition entrepreneurship.  \ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffbTeam Ori Eldarov (CEO) first came across this problem in 2019 - when he attempted (unsuccessfully) to acquire a business. A couple of years later, he saw dozens of his classmates at HBS go through the same struggles. Alston Lin (CTO) also struggled to find the right SMBs in the previous startup he founded - using existing tools that relied on broad industry buckets resulted in most outreach going to irrelevant businesses. However, with his experience working with big data and ranking engines at Facebook and Google, he knew he could build a better solution.

Cultural nuances regarding technology adoption in healthcare and trust in AI-driven medical advice need careful consideration.  Economic factors, including purchasing power of healthcare providers and institutions, must be assessed to ensure a sustainable business model. A phased approach focusing on specific high-value niches within larger hospital systems or government institutions might be more realistic than broad market penetration initially.  Language adaptation to Spanish (and potentially Portuguese for Brazil) is crucial. Addressing concerns about data privacy and security will be paramount given the sensitive nature of medical information.",

        "mvp": "The MVP should focus on a pilot program with a select group of emergency physicians in a single, larger city within a country with relatively good internet infrastructure (e.g.,  Mexico City, Bogot\u00e1, or Santiago). This allows for concentrated user feedback and minimizes initial rollout costs. The MVP should translate the platform into Spanish and focus on a limited set of high-frequency, critical medical queries relevant to emergency medicine.  Data integration with existing hospital systems should be simplified for this phase.  Success will be measured based on user adoption, feedback on accuracy, and time saved in clinical decision-making.  Building trust will be crucial; this could be achieved through partnerships with key opinion leaders (KOLs) within the medical community and emphasizing data security and transparency."

        "description": "0\u00a0https://www.usesynth.aiWe help AI agents learn from data.You add a few decorators to your agent code, and run your agent on a dataset of questions you've generated / collected in the wild. We give you back a dataset of message triplets that's ready to be uploaded to your fine-tuning provider of choice (OpenAI, OpenPipe, Anthropic, Gemini, etc) that will give you a language model ready to steer your agent in production more effectively.SynthFounded:2024Team Size:2Location:San FranciscoGroup Partner:Pete Koomen\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active FoundersJosh Purtell, FounderJosh is the founder and CEO of Synth.  Before Synth, Josh was employee #3 and research scientist at Basis, which uses AI agents to automate accounting tasks. Previously, he built out the ML core of a Cyber Threat Intelligence SaaS product at Halborn, a cyber security startup that acqui-hired his startup Politeia. He founded Politeia while wrapping up a Math undergrad at Yale, where he did time-series ml research for fun.Josh PurtellSynth\u00a0\u00a0Company LaunchesSynth: Automated Training for Vertical AI AgentsHi, I\u2019m Josh, founder of Synth. TL;DR We log what your agent is doing, identify where it\u2019s coming up short, and fine-tune the AI models your agent uses to prevent those failures. You add a few decorators to your code, run your agent, and get back fine-tuned models (via OpenAI or the provider of your choice) that perform better. Our product, when applied to SWE-Agent, an academic baseline, delivers a 33% relative improvement on the SWE-Bench agent benchmark with just 100 training data points.     Why is this important? Teams want to deploy software that automates economically meaningful tasks over multiple steps. Iterating on those systems is hard: an agent taking 100 steps to complete a task will often create a newspaper\u2019s worth of text data over just one task run, and reviewing a representative evaluation dataset can be daunting. Moreover, getting language models to demonstrate context-specific agentic behavior - such as following strong plans and making the best use of their environment - can be challenging, just with manual prompt tweaking. Working as an agent researcher at a startup automating accounting tasks, I struggled to parse through the reams of logs my systems would generate every time I wanted to test a potential improvement. Manually tweaking dozens of prompts and reasoning about how changes would propagate through the system was also difficult\u2014 and, for many problems, ineffective. As agents are deployed in more challenging applications and to more customers, these problems will grow. Agent developers need a tool that scales with their agent\u2019s complexity and scope in order to build state-of-the-art systems. Our solution Synth works in 3 steps  Communicate: We summarize your agent\u2019s logs to help you understand how it\u2019s performing at a glance. Flag: We identify common failure modes your agent is demonstrating. Address: We fine-tune base models your agent uses to address AI-related issues and suggest changes to your code when gaps in agent scaffolding are the root cause.  We worked with a startup that was working on automating code generation to increase their agent\u2019s success rate at an editing task from ~85% to 100% on a representative evaluation set. Why Now? Developers and researchers have been building AI agents with language models for years, but only somewhat recently have base models provided a strong enough foundation to enable the most ambitious applications. Moreover, some of the most powerful and consistent approaches for tuning agents to address domain-specific challenges\u2014 the ones powering Synth\u2014 have only been published in the last year or so. The market is ready for our solution, as is the research literature. Team I recently worked at Basis, a startup automating accounting tasks with AI agents, as a researcher developing and maintaining pipelines and agents used to serve top accounting firms. While there, I had the opportunity to publish academic research on the topic of agent optimization at EMNLP, a respected AI conference. Before Basis, I built a startup doing ML for cyber with some friends that got acqui-hired right out of the gate for a modest amount. Before then, I studied math and machine learning at Yale.

Engineers currently spend hours manually evaluating and playing whack-a-mole just to discover that fixing one issue introduces another. At Coval, we build automated simulation and evaluation for AI agents inspired by the autonomous vehicle industry to boost test coverage, speed up development, and validate consistent performance. We have a waitlist, but YC companies go first! Grab some time here: https://bit.ly/coval-demo  Our Story Hey! I\u2019m Brooke, the founder of Coval. \ud83d\udc4b Before starting Coval, I led the evaluation job infrastructure team at Waymo. I coded the first versions of our dataset storage and other foundational simulation systems, and my team built all of the dev tools for launching and running evals. Through my conversations with hundreds of engineering teams at startups and enterprises, I've seen that AI agents\u2014models that operate independently and handle complex tasks\u2014are facing similar challenges to those in self-driving. In the early days, autonomous vehicle companies relied heavily on manual evaluation, testing the self-driving cars on racetracks and city streets (remember when autonomous cars still had safety drivers?). However, as startups scaled, a significant shift happened: we moved towards simulating every code change in a \u201cvirtual\u201d environment, using the vast amounts of data we collected. The new approach dramatically improved vehicle behavior, leading to hundreds of autonomous cars zipping around the San Francisco streets today! This story mirrors what's happening today with AI agents across various industries. Teams are coming up with promising prototypes but often hit a wall when it comes to their reliability. As we build for the future, where AI agents execute much of our work, ranging from sending emails to prescribing medication, the risks posed by untested systems could severely throttle the progress. At Waymo, I developed tools that tested each code modification made by engineers, ensuring that every change improved the Waymo Driver's performance. I believe this methodical approach was key in helping our team address edge cases and maintain peak performance, and it ultimately cemented Waymo's status as a leader in the autonomous vehicle space. Now, at Coval, we\u2019re taking these proven strategies and adapting them in a completely new way to speed up the development of AI agents. Our goal is to help engineers build agent experiences that genuinely work for users in the real world.

Our customizable AI answers questions directly from your listings and books prospective tenants for tours after only 10 minutes of coaching via chat. Problem: Property managers deal with the pain of manually messaging prospective tenants around the clock in order to fill their vacancies. The questions are often repetitive and can come at any hour of the day through multiple channels (SMS, email, Facebook Messenger), adding overhead to their already busy schedule. However, responding to leads instantly is critical to convert quality leads in competitive rental markets.

We\u2019re now building Ionworks to scale up this success and bring the power of digital design to every single battery engineer.  The Need Batteries are a crucial technology underpinning the electrification of every application ranging from EVs to grid storage. This makes the battery market worth\u00a0$150b today (1.5% of global GDP), with projected growth to $680b in 10 years (4% of projected global GDP). However, batteries still need to improve massively to meet a difficult set of demands:\u00a0higher energy and power density, faster charge times, lower cost, longer lifetimes, and better safety.  Why designing better batteries is difficult Batteries come in all shapes and sizes, with complex and nonlinear effects of design inputs on performance outputs. As a result, battery engineering teams build and test thousands of physical prototypes to find the optimal design for their application. This is an expensive and time-consuming process (up to $1000 and 2 years for each individual test), which leads to\u00a0$100m/5 year battery development cycles. This makes batteries the bottleneck in many product development cycles, such as new laptops and electric cars. The Solution We\u2019re doing for batteries what CFD (computational fluid dynamics) did for aerodynamics and CAD (computer-aided design) did for structural and electrical engineering:\u00a0move the design problem into the digital world. Generic engineering software already exists but requires specialist knowledge and decades of experience to build battery-specific models. We\u2019re building software that makes this process available to any battery engineer. Our solution is built for the cloud, providing the interfaces and cost models to do this at scale.  How it works We move battery design into the digital world using the following process:  Collect a small amount of experimental data Parameterize (i.e. train) the physics-based model to find the parameter values that best match the experimental data Use the generated parameters to virtually explore the entire space of designs and operating conditions Pick the best candidates from the virtual experiments and test those in the physical world to validate the simulation results  The underlying physics-based models are old-school partial differential equations that describe the chemical reactions, lithium transport, and heat exchange happening inside a battery. These models generalize well from their training data, which allows us to build accurate models from small amounts of data.\u00a0Our secret sauce is that we\u2019ve built software that makes steps 2 and 3 fast and robust.

Abel answers complex questions across large legal records made up of many different types of documents. Our mission is to empower attorneys to practice more efficiently, so they can extend representation to more people.  tl;dr  Attorneys import documents from a variety of sources and formats (PDFs, emails, spreadsheets, docs). Abel processes the documents and creates a structured representation of the information contained in them (we call these: \u201centities\u201d). Attorneys understand the facts with more speed and precision than was previously possible.  Problem Many legal practice areas - including litigation, M&A, and insurance - routinely deal with large document sets, and attorneys spend many hours reviewing those documents to get the information they need. In an age of AI, law firm clients demand both increased efficiency and improved effectiveness. Existing technology solutions, like eDiscovery platforms, don\u2019t help attorneys understand the information that exists inside the documents. They\u2019re costly, cumbersome, and their search is difficult to use to pinpoint the relevant information. So, attorneys rely on manual document review, which is even more costly, prone to human error, and difficult to get client budget buy-in. Solution  Abel allows attorneys to get the depth of manual review at the scale of technology. Attorneys import legal records of a variety of document formats, types, and sizes. Abel leverages our proprietary entity extraction to process the documents and uncover a structured representation of the information contained in them. Our extraction pipelines are flexible and can be customized to identify the relevant entities to our customers\u2019 needs, which can include things like:  The people involved Clauses in agreements Relevant email threads Key legal issues Motions raised at trial Key events that occurred  Attorneys use Abel to explore the extracted entities and to examine the relationships between them.

This saves our customers $10k per family while providing an incredible employee perk: 100% coverage of a family\u2019s costs. We handle setup, employee education, and claims reimbursement. Hey everyone! I\u2019m Priyang and I\u2019m building Healia. We\u2019ve launched 14 customers in 11 states with $206k in ARR and counting.  \ud83d\ude31 The problem: Dual-income health insurance is a lose-lose for companies and families There are 41 million dual-income families in the country and they all have the same problem: whether they choose their plan or their spouse\u2019s, they still have thousands in premium contributions and out-of-pocket costs. Companies face a similar challenge: either employees enroll in their insurance and incur exorbitant costs ($17k/year/family) or the employee misses out on the largest employee benefit available, hurting the company\u2019s recruitment and retention efforts. \u2728 The solution: Both companies \u201csplit\u201d coverage Our product lets employers pay for the out-of-pocket costs (and premiums) of any employee who enrolls in their spouse's plan. There is no need for complicated coordination between employers. Employees just opt out of our customer\u2019s plans and join their spouse\u2019s. We then reimburse any eligible expenses on the spouse\u2019s plan. This saves our customers $10k per enrollee and boosts recruitment and retention with an awesome perk.  \ud83d\udca1 How it works (in three easy steps)  Account Creation: We set up individual accounts for enrollees, funded by employers for eligible expenses ($6k-10k on average). Enrollment: Employees access the funds when enrolled in their spouse's plan, using them to cover healthcare costs Unused Funds: Any unused funds revert to the employer, ensuring expenses remain capped while employees get the safety of knowing they have thousands of dollars of additional coverage.  \ud83d\udcbb Our technology is so powerful that we even sell it separately We created a tool for employees that lets them compare costs between their employer's plan and their spouse's. Employees can upload a PDF of their spouse\u2019s benefits guide, and our LLM will process the data, allowing families to see all of their options modeled out (see image below). This feature has been so popular that companies like GoFundMe, Stew Leonard\u2019s, and Sectigo use our technology just to educate employees on what plan to choose.  \ud83d\ude80 14 customers launched across 11 states with $206k in ARR Initially, we thought only white-collar companies would be interested, but half of our customers have been in traditional industries like manufacturing, food and beverage, and retail. We're helping businesses across all geographies and industries lower costs and make healthcare more affordable. \ud83d\udc4b Ask: Connect us with:  Health insurance brokers that need innovative solutions for clients. HR leaders and CFO\u2019s that want to lower costs while improving employee retention Or, just give us feedback! founders@healiahealth.com  Hear from the foundersHow did your company get started? (i.e., How did the founders meet? How did you come up with the idea? How did you decide to be a founder?)I started the company after choosing the wrong health insurance plan myself. Even with a decade of experience in health insurance, I misinterpreted my company's benefit guide and ended up with a significantly more expensive plan. I realized that existing tools to address this problem were either too cumbersome (like complex Excel files), overly simplistic, or required extensive time to complete.We created a tool that solved those problems and could be launched for an employer in less than an hour, rather than the days or weeks typically required. As we gained traction, we identified another critical need: most families are dual-income, so helping employees understand their employer\u2019s plans isn\u2019t enough. To fix this, we integrated an LLM to analyze your spouse\u2019s plan, making it really easy for an employee to upload their spouse\u2019s benefits guide with another employer to see all their options in one place (for the first time ever!).Despite our success, I realized we were only solving part of the problem for dual income families. I kept wondering why there wasn\u2019t a simpler, more economically efficient solution where both employers could pay for an insurance policy. That\u2019s how Healia today was born. Our product allows employers to pay for the out of pocket costs for any employee that enrolls in their spouse's health insurance plan. This saves our customers $10k per enrollee while providing an incredible employee perk: 100% coverage of a family's health costs. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?Our long-term vision is to create our own health insurance plan for dual income families. Imagine an insurance policy that traveled with you to every new place you or your spouse worked. Every employer would offer the Healia plan, so you never had to worry about new plan rules or deductibles, and your costs would always be covered 100% (half by your employer and half by your spouse\u2019s).This would also make health insurance significantly cheaper for employers as they would only pay for half the costs. Healia could then use its size to negotiate better rates from providers and  its technology to lower costs. ",
        "feasibility_analysis": "Healia's model presents a unique challenge in the Latin American context. While the core value proposition of reducing healthcare costs for dual-income families is universally appealing, several factors need careful consideration.  Market size is significant, as dual-income households are prevalent across the region, but the penetration of employer-sponsored health insurance varies considerably between countries.  Cultural nuances concerning family structures and employer-employee relationships must be analyzed on a country-by-country basis. Economic factors, such as varying levels of disposable income and the prevalence of informal employment, will influence adoption rates.  Regulatory complexities surrounding health insurance differ significantly across Latin American nations, requiring a nuanced approach to compliance and market entry strategies.  A phased rollout, starting with countries with more robust health insurance markets and regulatory frameworks (e.g., Chile, Mexico, Colombia), would be advisable. The significant cost savings for employers might be a compelling factor, especially for larger corporations, while smaller businesses might require tailored solutions and potentially face challenges with the necessary tech infrastructure and administrative capacity.

        "mvp": "The MVP should focus on a single country with a relatively developed tech and insurance infrastructure (e.g., Chile or Mexico).  Initially, limit the offering to a smaller subset of the Healia's functionalities: the employee-centric tool comparing spouse and employer plans (LLM-powered comparison).  Partner with one or two larger companies to pilot the program, providing a focused user base for feedback.  This will allow gathering critical data, validating the LLM's accuracy across different insurance providers in the target market, and refining the user experience before launching the reimbursement component of the Healia solution.  The MVP should gather feedback on the user experience, including the language comprehension and cultural relevance of the interface and communication.  Initial focus on Spanish-speaking markets is crucial, with further localization necessary for each country."

Besides that, scaling into multiple channels often entails adding new warehouse locations through the supply chain, be it by sourcing raw materials by yourself or adding FBA as an outbound fulfiller. This is accompanied by rising logistics costs and inventory constraints (such as the low inventory level fee of Amazon or expiration date requirements for sales channels). The combination of these aspects leaves supply chain managers with a sheer amount of different constraints to handle \u2013 often in very large spreadsheets. This leads to inventory distortion costs \u2013 the cost of stockouts and overstock \u2013 which is a $1.8 trillion USD problem for retailers worldwide. \u2705\u00a0The solution Spherecast combines demand planning, replenishment and inventory optimization in one platform.

Hey everyone! We're Max and Arhan, founders of Rove, and we're thrilled to introduce the first travel credit card for young adults. Our journeys began at Wharton and Harvard, where we built ventures around specialized Bluetooth software to connect people at events and a B2B edtech recruiting platform for schools and startups. We scaled our ventures by day and slept on planes by night, traveling the world for free.  Arhan and Max Despite travel-hacking our way to over 50 countries, none of our friends could do the same. The barriers? Stringent credit requirements based on outdated underwriting algorithms (FICO), ludicrous fees, and antiquated software systems turned the dream of free travel into a complicated puzzle. We may have been able to hack the system, but we always wished for one that didn\u2019t need to be hacked and rewarded users by default instead. The Problem: Gaps in Accessibility and Usability Right now, the travel credit card market fails to serve the people who want to travel the most. Existing cards are like computers were in the early 2000s: they work, but they\u2019re expensive, many people can\u2019t access them, and even those who can struggle to use them without help. We\u2019re building the iPhone of travel cards\u2014one that\u2019s easy to use, readily accessible, and seamlessly intuitive. These two market inefficiencies create one of the best opportunities in consumer credit in decades. Our Solution: Rove Rove is here to democratize reward travel, finally offering the first-ever no-annual-fee travel card for Gen Z. We use advanced algorithms and data aggregation systems to underwrite users in a radically more accessible way. By using people\u2019s cash flow from connecting to their banks, as opposed to outdated data points like mortgages and decades of credit history, we can more accurately underwrite an entirely untapped demographic of users. But we didn't stop there\u2014we want reward travel to not only be available to young adults but easy to use too. Our platform introduces the first-ever portal for direct redemption of airline loyalty deals, making the process of traveling the world for free as effortless as it should be. With our alliance of partner airlines, the average Gen Z spender can earn a free annual trip overseas. Soon after our card launch, we\u2019re leveraging better data and software technology to maximize user rewards across an accessible suite of financial products. Experience Rove   Join Us on This Journey We're on a mission to make the world more accessible to young adults everywhere by building a financial suite of products geared toward travel. In the short term, that\u2019s our travel card. In the long term, it\u2019s about expanding access to products globally that allow users to travel based on their spending and savings, leveraging our data flywheel to better underwrite the billions of underbanked people across the world. If you're tired of missing out on travel opportunities because of credit barriers or complex points systems, Rove is for you. For now, our waitlist is only available through the invite code YCLAUNCH.

We are Sourav, Sammy and Adam, and we\u2019re creating an AI copilot that automates the deal deck creation and financial analysis process for CRE (commercial real estate) brokers. For example, Henry can create a full deal package for a broker selling an office building in Dogpatch in minutes instead of weeks. This will ensure that brokers maximize their time in the most value-added part of their business: relationships and sales.  (Sourav is remote!) Traditional brokers often spend as much as 50% of their time on tasks that do not contribute to their bottom line. From basic financial analysis to marketing presentations to win future business to basic operational support, brokers often struggle with the manual and time-consuming realities of their business. These tasks are an incredibly painful bottleneck for brokers, which interferes with their primary goal of building relationships to buy and sell property. We are creating Henry to solve this problem. Henry is an AI copilot that takes all of the messy, unstructured data that defines CRE transactions and consolidates it into clean marketing deliverables & financial analyses in minutes rather than weeks. Long term, we plan on automating the entire deal flow process for brokers to make their cycle time for a deal an order of magnitude faster. You can find an example of what we do below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZm40bj5mL0   I (Sammy) led Lev for the last five years, a 200+ person series B real estate financing marketplace that I co-founded.

Students have to use multiple learning apps - note-taking, flashcards, quizzes, AI help, tutoring, and reminder apps - to have a complete learning experience. From speaking to numerous students (and being former students ourselves), there is a significant opportunity to use AI to make studying a truly seamless end-to-end experience that understands the student deeply. From an educational institution\u2019s perspective: The AI genie is out of the bottle, and existing institutions realize this and are deeply concerned about how to embrace AI and deliver the value it promises to their students in a safe and impactful manner without compromising the goal of education delivery. This is what Shepherd provides. Imagine a world with 19M college students (to start with) getting an institution-endorsed AI-enabled learning assistant in their pocket. Students get education-specific workflows, not just chatbots, access to tutors, and a learning community. Institutions get analytics, control on prompting, and the ability to monitor academic dishonesty. This is the future of education. What is your long-term vision? If you truly succeed, what will be different about the world?Every learner has Shepherd in their pocket. This means they have a personalized learning assistant designed specifically for them to enable them to excel at any subject they choose. Selected answers from Shepherd's original YC application for the W24 BatchDescribe what your company does in 50 characters or less.

Cultural nuances also play a crucial role; adapting the platform's user interface, content, and tutoring style to resonate with diverse learning preferences and communication styles is paramount.  Economic factors, such as affordability and pricing strategies, will significantly influence adoption rates.  A tiered pricing model that offers varying levels of access could improve market penetration.  Moreover, the platform's integration with existing educational institutions will be critical for successful adoption.",

        "mvp": "The MVP should focus on a single core feature \u2013 for instance, AI-powered personalized study plans based on a student's course material. This could be offered to a pilot group of students at one or two universities initially, focusing on a specific subject (e.g., mathematics or Spanish) and a chosen country (e.g., Colombia or Mexico) with good internet penetration and a relatively high digital literacy rate. The feedback gathered will inform further development and refinement of the platform's other features, such as tutoring and peer collaboration, before expanding to other institutions and regions.  Emphasis should be placed on creating a user-friendly interface in Spanish, incorporating culturally relevant examples and content, and offering flexible payment options."

TL;DR: We create agents that walk through your core flows (sign up, onboarding, etc.) just like real users and report any bugs they find. Zero-setup required, just tell us what you want to test and we take care of the rest. Watch a quick demo of how we find bugs here:   \u00a0\u00a0 \ud83d\udc4e QA Sucks\u2026 QA testing is traditionally a rigid and fragile process. Tests are:  Extremely tedious to set up Super inconsistent (flaky) Inflexible to changes on your website Blind to visual bugs  Because of this, you need dedicated personnel to build and maintain entire test suites to actually catch bugs. \u00a0\u00a0 \ud83d\udc7e Our solution: Human-like QA Agents We build AI agents that navigate your website like real users to identify bugs. With simple natural language instructions, our agents iteratively execute actions on your website and analyze the screens they encounter to identify issues. Here\u2019s an example of a test:  We set up an agent to follow a natural language goal, like \u201ccreate an account and finish onboarding.\u201d After executing an action (e.g. a click or keystroke), the agent ensures everything on the site is visually consistent and that the action worked as intended. Any visual, functional, or miscellaneous bugs are flagged and reported in real time\u2014no predefined assertions or rigid rules required.  To make things even easier, we set up all tests for you and run them on your preferred schedule\u2014 just tell us what you need! \u00a0 \ud83d\udc4b Get In Touch If you\u2019re trying to ship fast and can\u2019t afford to have your website break, please reach out!

        "feasibility_analysis": "Fix AI's AI-powered website testing service presents a mixed bag for the Latin American market.  The core value proposition \u2013 automated bug detection \u2013 is universally relevant. However, market penetration hinges on several factors.  Market size will be largely determined by the concentration of tech companies in specific Latin American countries (e.g., Mexico, Brazil, Colombia) that can afford this service. Cultural nuances are less of a concern as the service is technical.  Economic factors are crucial; the cost of the service must be competitive with existing, possibly cheaper, QA practices.  A key challenge will be overcoming language barriers, requiring multilingual support and documentation in Spanish and Portuguese, at a minimum.  Furthermore, internet infrastructure variability across the region needs consideration when designing the agents' performance and reliability.",

        "mvp": "The MVP should focus on a limited set of features and target a specific niche within the Latin American market.  Initially, focus on a single country (e.g., Mexico or Brazil) with strong internet infrastructure and a high concentration of tech companies.  The MVP could offer a free trial with limited testing capacity, concentrating on a single, well-defined user flow (e.g., account creation).  Gather feedback from early adopters to identify pain points and tailor the service to local needs.  Emphasis should be placed on clear, concise Spanish and Portuguese documentation and support.  This phased approach allows for iterative development based on real-world usage in the target market, and avoids significant upfront investment in a broadly applicable service."
